	10	17	traffic committee of 10.1. So I suppose we should open the traffic committee.		10080	17440
	17	20	Oh no we'll hear the public forum first then we can do it.		17440	19760
	20	32	Yep okay this is to do with the cycleway in Heath Street so just if I call your name out		19760	31920

	61	78	Heath Street one are you? Yes we are.		61040	77520
	78	81	Sorry Mr there's a lot of audible conversation it's hard to hear people speak.		77520	80880
	81	88	If you need to speak anybody that's please we would like everybody to you know listen and		80880	87600
	88	95	hear what's going on so if you need to speak the door's there go for it. Once in here please		87600	94800
	96	98	respect the floor and the speakers.		95840	98080
	101	106	Yeah so yeah we're only dealing with a little 200 meter section of the bikeway we're not dealing		100720	106160
	106	112	with the whole lot. We're not going to speak about anything else because we've got a specific report		106160	111840
	112	124	to do with Heath Street.		111840	123600
	124	130	We're only going to speak about Heath Street tonight. We're not right and with Baybug if I		123600	129840
	130	137	might just wish to ask you please it's a number of your speakers here tonight.		129840	136640
	137	144	We'd love to hear everything you have to say but not three four five times so keep it nice and short		136640	143840
	144	152	keep it to the issue and that's Heath Street and we all want to try to create a better		143840	152480
	152	157	liveable area Canada Bay but we're not going to solve the whole problem of the cycleway		152480	157280
	157	164	here tonight. We're only going to speak about Heath Street so once you start going off about		157280	163760
	164	169	other cycleways we're going to stop you there. Only Heath Street tonight talking about 200 meters		163760	169360
	169	175	and that's what we'll hear about so if you can please keep to that that would be great.		169360	174800
	175	181	So we'll let you go on about it Heath Street but just don't keep repeating. So first speaker Ralph		174800	181120
	181	201	I apologize. Please accept my apologies. I understand what you mean. My name's pretty hard to pronounce.		181120	200960
	201	215	I've been Ralphed all my life. I'm a bit sensitive to it. Mr. Mayor and Councillor I'm speaking as a		200960	214560
	215	220	representative of the Canada Bay Bicycle User Group and first of all let me acknowledge that		214560	220480
	220	227	the concerns voiced by residents that led to the proposal to remove the cycleway are genuinely held		220480	227440
	227	234	beliefs and that they should be taken seriously. Each concern must be thoroughly evaluated		227440	234160
	234	241	in careful consideration be given to addressing them. To me council's proposal along with the		234160	241280
	241	248	consultant report that attempts to support it does none of that and represents a knee-jerk reaction		241280	247600
	248	256	to put the matter to bed in the most politically expedient way. As someone who uses my bike to		248240	255600
	256	261	commute do the grocery shopping and travel around some of the wonderful destinations around Greater		255600	261440
	261	268	Sydney I was very pleased last September to see what I believed to be the first section in Heath		261440	267520
	268	276	Street of the taxpayer funded Canada Bay Regional Cycleway actually completed. I've written that		267520	275760
	276	282	section by myself and with much less able riders in the 20 plus years before the cycleway was in		275760	282240
	282	289	place and always felt like a sitting duck while grinding slowly up the hill. Nearby streets are		282240	289200
	289	295	harder to climb or have more exposure to motor traffic. Heath Street with its combination of		289200	295440
	295	302	lower traffic volumes and easier climb has always been the natural choice for those who cycle from		295440	302320
	302	310	the Bayrun and Timberl Park towards Central Five Dock and beyond. I asked Professor Miad Saberi from		302320	310240
	310	317	the University of New South Wales on the bike traffic modelling he has done and he said that		310240	316560
	317	326	Heath Street accommodates between 94 and 100 to 185 cycling trips per weekday on average excluding		316560	325520
	326	336	"weekends that means between 23,500 and 46,250 cycling trips per year. Those estimates were based"		325520	335760
	336	345	"on 2021 data. If you count in weekends the number is likely to exceed 50,000 trips per year. Those"		335760	344560
	345	352	were his words not mine. I was gobsmacked when I discovered a few months later the council now		344560	351680
	352	358	proposes to remove what looked to me like a well thought out piece of infrastructure that finally		351680	357760
	358	364	takes into account the safety of all road users. There are hundreds of kilometers of separated		357760	363600
	364	369	cycleway throughout Sydney a significant proportion of which run through residential		363600	369120
	369	375	streets like Heath Street and to my knowledge they have not led to an increase of risk or hazard		369120	374720
	375	381	to any particular category of road user. In fact I understand the net effect has been to reduce		374720	381200
	381	386	the number and severity of crashes in the neighborhoods where they are located.		381200	385520
	387	393	So while trying to distill the gist of the Heath Street residents concerns it occurred to me that		387280	393040
	393	399	the main issue was a sudden change to the streetscape and I acknowledge that that can be very distressing.		393040	399360
	401	406	It must be stated that Heath Street is not the exclusive property of the residents that live there		400640	405680
	406	412	nor the Timberl Park sports people that park there on weekends and weeknights and certainly		406400	412080
	412	418	not the people who ride their bikes along there. Heath Street is there for all road users in New		412080	418400
	418	424	South Wales to use. Like the Land Act says streets are provided for the movement of people.		418400	423840
	426	432	When I bought my house in Corrie's Avenue 23 years ago I was never asked if I thought it was		425760	431760
	432	438	okay for motor traffic to increase by a factor of three nor was I asked if it was okay for the		431760	438400
	438	444	street to become so solidly parked out a lot of the time that I have to take much more care looking		438400	444000
	444	453	out for traffic when I drive my car out of the driveway. Yet that's what's happened and unlike		444000	453200
	453	460	the residents of Heath Street there was not one iota of consultation. Canada Bay's environmental		453200	460160
	460	469	"strategy from 2020 forecasts a population to increase from 79,000 in 2018 to 120,000 by 2036."		460160	469360
	469	477	By my sums that's an increase of 52 percent in that time the strategy forecasts walking to increase		469360	476560
	477	484	to 20 percent and cycling to increase to five percent by 2036. The way we are headed it seems		476560	484080
	484	490	like those figures are way too ambitious while council has a track record they can be proud of		484080	489840
	490	498	putting down walking and cycling tracks in uncontested spaces in places like parks and		489840	498240
	498	506	foreshores they have great benefits for recreation. The same can't be said for making road space safe		498240	505760
	506	511	for kids to ride their bikes to school or mums and dads to ride to work or to do the shopping.		505760	511280
	512	517	For the strategic plan to have any chance of actually working active transport.		512000	517200
	517	523	Ralph do you need more time your five minutes is up? About 30 seconds. I'll put it all in place.		517200	522720
	523	529	I always have it declared. Thank you. Thank you. Where was I? For the strategic plan to have any		522720	529280
	529	536	chance to actually work active transport must be taken seriously otherwise we'll be seeing 52 percent		529280	536080
	536	542	more cars clogging our roads and taking up non-existent parking spaces. Finally I would		536080	541760
	542	549	like to remind councillors the regional cycleway is not for people like me who you see are confidently		541760	548880
	549	554	rising riding in traffic it's for those you don't see because they are justifiably scared to ride		548880	554320
	554	560	their bikes on the road. I therefore ask council that the removal be deferred for a trial period		554320	560080
	561	567	while specific concerns are investigated in partnership as offered by Transport for New		560560	567280
	567	573	South Wales experts. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak tonight. Thank you Ralph.		567280	572720
	573	580	Did Ralph bring you did he bring all the baby issues to the floor or do we need to hear another		572720	580480
	580	586	another one okay all right David Martin please.		580480	585600
	589	595	"Thanks Mr Mayor, councillors, officers, ladies and gentlemen. I'll just reiterate that last point that"		589120	594880
	595	598	we are really seeing a lot of people who are not really interested in the		594880	598240
	598	603	traffic and the safety of their vehicles. We want to see an improvement in streets in Canada Bay		598240	603280
	603	609	for people walking for children for families for young people and that's what's happened with this		603280	608720
	609	614	200 meters is we're getting people who wouldn't ride normally feeling safe that they're protected		608720	614080
	614	620	"from traffic. I'm a parent a grandparent, ex-primary school teacher and I've got a 25 year career"		614080	620480
	620	627	in transport including in road safety so I'm only saying that to give you a little bit of a		620480	626960
	627	632	I'm only saying that to demonstrate I've got some understanding of the issues related to here so I'm		626960	631680
	632	637	here to oppose the removal it's an excellent facility as Ralph says and we recognize that the		631680	636960
	637	642	residents have got strongly held concerns but I think we can offer a constructive way forward.		636960	642480
	644	649	I don't believe the evidence that's been put forward in the paper that's come to council with		643520	649120
	649	653	the recommendation to remove it. I don't think the evidence really stacks up and I think the		649120	652800
	653	659	significant thing we should note is the transport for New South Wales voted against the proposal to		652800	659280
	659	664	remove it. They're the experts in this area and they've voted against it and if you go through the		659280	664400
	667	674	I do. Transport technically and in terms of regional network and cycleways they've got a		666880	674400
	674	678	whole lot of guidelines they've got the I don't want to go on but yes of course they are.		674400	678320
	678	687	So there are six pages and they go through here if you've read the agenda item the six pages you'll		678320	686720
	687	692	see that they're refuting each of the points and I'll just make some of those look and the broader		686720	692240
	692	698	point is that the impetus for the removal of the cycleway comes from the fact that circumstances		692240	698400
	698	706	in the streets in the lovely area of Rudd Point have changed and people are having trouble adapting		698400	705600
	706	710	to it and they've got very upset. Some of the points the key points that have been raised in		705600	709840
	710	717	opposition is the reduced width of Heath Street it's with the cycleway from those concrete buffers		709840	717040
	717	723	to the curb 8.859 meters and they're saying oh you know they could be head-on collisions.		717040	723200
	724	731	Well my street in Fyfe Duc where I live it's 6.6 meters and the difference is something like that		723840	731120
	731	738	so transport says that it's not a problem it's very generous with compared with streets around		731120	737520
	739	743	Will Sydney and Fyfe Duc and in Rod Point too it's a very wide street		738640	742960
	745	748	we've coped with it in my street there are no head-ons		744640	747600
	750	755	people it's called the Yield Street if cars are coming together one must give way to the other		749520	754960
	755	762	you've got to duck in that's the way it works it's not that hard. Sight lines drivers leaving driveways		754960	761600
	762	768	yes it's it's changed transport says they've got to check for bicycles as they come out of their		761600	767680
	768	774	properties then go past the parked cars and check for traffic you've got to creep out that's the way		767680	773840
	774	779	you do it this is Sydney there's a lot of traffic there's a lot of um there's need to be careful		773840	779200
	779	785	things are changing. Heath and Rickard we need to investigate it because they're talking about the		779200	784720
	785	791	sight lines you may need to move the give way line you might need to put in some concrete curve		784720	791200
	791	796	extensions transport says it's it's fixable in fact all the problems that are raised		791200	795920
	797	804	can be fixed by it's transport management 101 the other thing too is is community engagement		796560	804000
	804	809	what we've done what council's done with this with the community consultation is invite everybody		804000	809040
	809	815	to throw in all their bits and pieces about what they like or don't like what's really		809040	814800
	815	820	going to happen now is the community's got to be engaged one-on-one if they see problems		814800	819600
	820	826	that they'd like to see resolved so it's a different model okay so there may be tweaks required		820160	825600
	826	832	to the concrete separators to you might need to get a driving instructor in to coach people		825600	832320
	832	838	about driving in and out that has happened that has happened in other places you've really got to		832320	837840
	838	846	you've really got to help people adapt to change the uh the external traffic engineer says remove		837840	846480
	846	851	the cycle way to be safer for all road users absolutely no consideration in that report		846480	851280
	852	859	of the safety of bicycle users and that separation uh gives and taking it out is going to deter		852000	859120
	859	867	people from riding bikes the officer's report fails to note that the majority of respondents		859120	866560
	867	873	to the community consultation oppose a removal this is really about the interest of a small group		866560	872560
	873	880	of agitated residents over the benefits of everybody else in canada bay might also draw		873360	879760
	880	884	attention to financial matters ripping it out council's going to have to pay for it		879760	884240
	884	889	uh and it may result in financial penalties from the state authorities and place future		884240	889360
	889	896	funding in jeopardy the state and federal fund funding sources really support much of the traffic		889360	895680
	896	901	management that we're introducing like the wombats and the refuges around the streets we can		895680	900720
	901	906	congratulate the council for getting that money because those funds are there but the waste is		900720	905680
	906	911	not a good look not a good look do you need extra time yes one minute please		905680	910800
	911	919	one minute all those in favor say aye say no no no i'm going please thank you okay		910800	918800
	922	926	so the way the waste is not a good look for council after concord oval and all the other issues that		921520	925520
	926	932	we've had um and i think the problems that it introduces with state funding is um is really		925520	932480
	932	939	we can avoid it we can avoid it um so transport for new south wales is often a problem and we		932480	939120
	939	944	we're not going to be able to do that so transport for new south wales is offering a joint reveal of		939120	943760
	944	950	the design to balance all user requirements and all user safety issues and we support council		943760	949840
	950	956	accepting that offer so i urge council is to frame a motion i ask that you frame a motion		949840	955920
	956	960	you've got to reject the recommendation from traffic committee and that'll be terrific or		955920	960160
	960	965	defer the decision pending the development in conjunction with transport for new south wales		960160	964560
	965	972	and the history that balances all user requirements and all user safety issues thank you thank you		964560	971840
	972	979	very much thank you miss martin can i ask for the next speaker please francis o'neill		971840	979120
	988	994	evening everyone um this will be short uh i'm francis o'neill from bicycle new south wales		987840	994000
	994	1001	uh peak body for active transport i want to thank canada bay council for the opportunity to support		994000	1000960
	1002	1008	the excellent cycleway that's on the heath street when i rode it i thought wow you know this is		1001840	1008160
	1008	1018	generously wide it's wonderful um future planning sustainability active travel the distance between		1008160	1017520
	1018	1024	the school the oval we're all about getting kids and old people from eight to eighty riding and		1017520	1024240
	1024	1031	active the cycleway improves safety for vulnerable road users by being separated it therefore		1024240	1031200
	1031	1038	encourages the 48 interested but concerned people to take up bike riding road paint will never		1031200	1037920
	1038	1047	achieve this outcome um heath street's safe convenient direct it's attractive to use uh this		1037920	1047120
	1047	1053	is why after only four months the strava bike count is pretty high that was something ralph		1047120	1052960
	1053	1061	mentioned encouraging active transport to reduce congestion reach net zero and improve our health		1052960	1060800
	1061	1067	is why the heath street cycleway was built it's why we've got active transport plans sustainability		1060800	1067440
	1067	1076	future proofing etc okay yeah i won't be long stick to history yep yep this is heath street		1067440	1076080
	1076	1083	it's related because on the basis of those plans canada bay council demonstrated its commitment to		1076080	1083440
	1083	1089	active transport sustainability net zero and received seven million dollars new south wales		1083440	1088800
	1089	1095	government funding in good faith in good faith the last traffic committee minutes noted that		1088800	1095360
	1095	1102	heath street remains the most appropriate and strategic cycleway route along the paramounted		1095360	1101840
	1102	1108	to cbd corridor that's why it got the funding the last minutes also noted transport for new south		1101840	1108320
	1108	1114	wales has offered to review and improve the concept design as have bicycle new south wales		1108320	1114160
	1114	1121	as has canada bay bugs okay i'm almost finished we disagree however with the previous minutes		1114160	1121440
	1121	1129	noting that the removal of the cycleway will incur no additional cost okay firstly on two points		1121440	1129200
	1129	1136	canada bay is likely to be asked by transport for new south wales to refund the portion or all of		1129200	1136320
	1136	1143	the destroyed infrastructure spent secondly destruction of stage one risks the integrity		1136320	1143440
	1143	1150	of the whole seven million dollar project in all its six stages the other financial implication is		1143440	1150400
	1150	1157	that canada bay will be reviewed as an unreliable business partner for the many future transport		1150400	1156640
	1157	1163	for new south wales active transport projects in the pipeline this cycleway is only four months old		1156640	1163280
	1163	1171	and already doing so well so it lets everybody take a deep breath yeah just as it takes time to		1163280	1170560
	1171	1178	create something so it creates it takes a bit of time to destroy it time is your friend canada bay		1170560	1178400
	1178	1185	council time is your friend both sides agree this is where both sides agree consultation wasn't		1178400	1184960
	1185	1192	done right yeah okay so let's use the time wisely before you just rip it out because you might get		1184960	1192240
	1192	1198	it wrong you never know it is best practice on projects like this to bring the community		1192240	1198080
	1198	1204	on board through a process of co-design whereby stakeholders learn about the many benefits		1198080	1203760
	1204	1212	they get to air their concerns and get to shape the outcome it's advisable to consult with experts		1204480	1211600
	1212	1220	on co-design to ensure success because that runs on the board i have outlined some of the reputational		1211600	1219840
	1220	1227	and financial costs of trashing great infrastructure such as the heath street cycleway another cost is		1219840	1226640
	1227	1234	is that canada bay will gain a reputation of being a walkover among the anti-cycleway lobby		1227280	1234400
	1234	1240	making active transport projects that much harder to deliver you're creating a rod for your own back		1234400	1240000
	1240	1247	by making this decision so take some time think it through finally let's remember public roads		1240000	1246960
	1247	1252	are public roads and not the private property of residents who happen to live along them		1246960	1252160
	1252	1271	they are for the benefit of all road users		1252160	1271040
	1282	1299	um so again um a bit disappointed on you know bicycle new south wales taking that approach		1282160	1298720
	1299	1312	about canada bay mike bottle please uh president of baybug thank you		1298720	1312480
	1314	1318	good evening sir mayor councillors ladies and gentlemen thank you for the opportunity		1314080	1318240
	1319	1326	um as president of baybug i'm the elected representative our local area um bicycle users		1318960	1325840
	1326	1330	these are bicycle users of all ages their children cycling to school and local parks		1325840	1330480
	1330	1338	in mothers and fathers often with toddler seats attached and they're some of our senior citizens		1330480	1337520
	1338	1343	possibly with the electrical assistance to their bikes to help their mobility their commuters		1337520	1342800
	1343	1349	and their leisure riders many if not most of these bicycle users do not feel safe riding on our		1342800	1349360
	1349	1356	public roads i can say this with confidence because i'm in my role as president over the last five		1349360	1355760
	1356	1361	years i've met over 100 members who often express these concerns not only for themselves but for		1355760	1361280
	1361	1368	their spouses for their children and their parents all bicycle users under the law have the right to		1361280	1368000
	1368	1372	use our public roads we all understand the responsibility of our authorities to provide		1368000	1372240
	1372	1377	a safe road system for our motorists it's time that the same energy and expertise was put into		1372240	1377280
	1377	1385	designing safe access routes for bicycle users the separated cycleway the 200 meter uphill stretch		1377280	1384800
	1385	1391	in heath street provides that safe environment and marks a welcoming beginning to a shift in		1384800	1390720
	1391	1397	design thinking in canada bay and aligns us with progressive councils that have rolled out kilometers		1390720	1396800
	1397	1404	of separated cycleways to remove it and force riders to climb that hill at low speed potentially		1396800	1403760
	1404	1411	with impatient drivers behind them is to create a much more dangerous environment a view that is		1403760	1410800
	1411	1416	supported by transport for new south wales as ministered in the traffic committee meetings		1410800	1416400
	1418	1422	the recommendation by council officers to remove the separated cycleway was driven i believe by		1417680	1422240
	1422	1430	objections from residents of heat street understandable objections given the changes but		1422240	1430000
	1430	1434	and this prompted council to commission an independent report known as the mcclaren report		1430000	1433920
	1435	1440	for a brief period that report was available for viewing on the collaborate canada bay site and in		1434960	1440080
	1440	1446	reading it i failed to see any obvious connection from the data and observations noted to how the		1440080	1445520
	1446	1450	conclusions were reached i was particularly astonished by the summary which states and i		1445520	1450160
	1450	1456	quote the resultant works meaning the construction of the separated cycleway have generally reduced		1450160	1455840
	1456	1464	the safety of all users for all movements along along across and access via heat street end of		1455840	1464320
	1464	1469	quote surely no one could argue that the separated cycleway has reduced the safety		1464320	1468800
	1470	1473	of bicycle users compared to the alternative of riding on the road		1469600	1472720
	1474	1482	i've lived in first avenue some 30 meters from the corner of um heat street for 32 years and as a		1474320	1482320
	1482	1487	resident of first avenue i've welcomed the recent changes that have had significant calming effect		1482320	1486720
	1487	1493	on motor traffic vehicles and namely the speed humps and the raised crossing at heat street		1487200	1492800
	1494	1498	and which i'm sure the locals know like many of the residents of heat street who are claiming		1493520	1498320
	1498	1503	that it's more difficult now to back out of their driveways i too have to use extreme caution when		1498320	1503280
	1503	1509	backing into first avenue from my driveway the new traffic calming devices have improved that		1503280	1508720
	1509	1515	situation their speeds are now noticeably reduced in first avenue this too will surely be the effect		1508720	1515120
	1515	1520	in heat street as motorists become more accustomed to the narrowing and reduce their speed accordingly		1515120	1520480
	1521	1527	council has already acknowledged that speeds have reduced from an average of 48 kilometers an hour		1521440	1527040
	1527	1534	in heat street before the cycleway went in to now 44 kilometers as for the objection that the street		1527040	1534320
	1534	1540	is now too narrow to back into safely and an opinion supported by the mclaren report i ask		1534320	1540480
	1540	1546	by what measure even with the adjusted widths after construction of the separated cycleway the		1540480	1545520
	1546	1554	carriageway curb to curb distance of heat street is between 9.05 and 9.1 meters i've measured this		1545520	1554000
	1555	1559	with the exception of arthur street which is a busy through road i've measured all the other		1554800	1558960
	1559	1565	parallel streets in rod point and found they're all under eight meters more than a meter narrower		1558960	1564960
	1565	1573	than heath street so by what measure is it unsafe for heat street as it now conforms to the suburb		1564960	1572640
	1573	1580	norm in summary i ask that council move to defer the traffic committee recommendation to remove		1572640	1579600
	1580	1585	the cycleway pending a design review offered by transport for new south wales representative on		1579600	1584800
	1585	1590	the traffic committee and council's own traffic studies and the expressed intention to look at		1584800	1590160
	1590	1597	further traffic calming finally i ask all councillors here present to demonstrate their		1590160	1596560
	1597	1602	commitment to creating a safe safer streets for all users and to encourage active transport and a		1596560	1602320
	1602	1608	reduction in reliance on cars thereby reducing emissions by voting against the removal of the		1602320	1607680
	1608	1614	separated cycleway thank you thank you mr potten uh ross i want to ask you to come up yet because		1607680	1614240
	1614	1620	there's another speaker for the bay bugs i'll keep them in line so uh could i have angsirra please		1614240	1620240
	1621	1626	come up and address the council		1621040	1626240
	1626	1632	good evening mr mayor councillors my name is ann schwirb and i'm representing the peninsula's		1626240	1631600
	1632	1639	action group we are community advocate group and we work with council on a range of local concerns		1631600	1638800
	1639	1646	including transport traffic pedestrian safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety		1638800	1645680
	1646	1652	and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety		1645680	1652480
	1652	1677	matters here today each council's action group consists of five Agenda 9		1652480	1676620
	1677	1682	"if it was approved, will essentially dismember the Council's proposed"		1676620	1681520
	1682	1688	corridor of active transport access that feeds directly into our peninsula		1681520	1688380
	1688	1694	communities and on to the farthest reaches of the LGA. The following are		1688380	1694320
	1694	1700	just a few of Council's plans and guidelines that rely on the retention of		1694320	1699560
	1700	1705	the Heath Street cycleway component as part of the overarching active transport		1699560	1705440
	1705	1711	strategy for the whole of the Canada Bay LGA. Document 1 is the City of Canada Bay		1705440	1710940
	1711	1718	Local Planning Strategy 2010-31 and we quote directly from that		1710940	1717560
	1718	1724	document which proposes the delivery of a new regional cycleway that connects		1717560	1724220
	1724	1731	western and eastern parts of the LGA and further the delivery of a		1724220	1731460
	1731	1738	regional bike route that links Sydney City and Sydney Olympic Park across the		1731460	1737940
	1738	1745	Canada Bay LGA. The second document that we refer to is the City of Sydney Canada		1737940	1744700
	1745	1751	Bay Bike Plan 2020 available on Council's website which states to develop in		1744700	1750740
	1751	1759	detail a core spinal cycleway network throughout the Canada Bay LGA and it		1750740	1759260
	1759	1767	goes on to say perhaps most importantly to enable people to cycle safely.		1759260	1766660
	1767	1773	Following the recent completion of the fantastic redevelopment of Concord Oval		1766660	1772820
	1773	1781	the proposed removal of the Heath Street cycleway link would mean many local		1772820	1780740
	1781	1787	families including children wishing to use active transport to attend this		1780740	1787300
	1787	1796	world-class venue would have no way of doing so safely. This brings us to refer		1787300	1795900
	1796	1801	to document 3 on Council's website which is the Concord Oval Precinct Management		1795900	1801300
	1801	1808	Plan which recommends within the document the development of cycleway		1801300	1807520
	1808	1814	connections to Concord Oval. Now there's the matter of the appropriate government		1807520	1814300
	1814	1819	use of government funding. The government funding for local infrastructure		1814300	1818620
	1819	1825	projects are generous gifts that benefit the whole of the Canada Bay community.		1818620	1824780
	1825	1831	These grants assist councils such as ours to achieve its vision for the		1824780	1831180
	1831	1836	amenity of local communities without the need to place additional		1831180	1835980
	1836	1842	financial burdens on local ratepayers. Crucially at this time when Council is		1835980	1842340
	1842	1850	proposing to raise council rates substantially. To now propose to rip up		1842340	1850420
	1850	1857	this frequently used and funded completed infrastructure we believe		1850420	1856860
	1857	1863	would certainly give the government as the President of Baybug has		1856860	1862580
	1863	1870	alluded to it would give the government pause when considering future grants for		1862580	1869500
	1870	1877	our LGA. This is even more important when we are aware that Transport for New South		1869500	1877140
	1877	1885	Wales has very very strenuously opposed the destruction of this infrastructure.		1877140	1884540
	1885	1890	We would now ask that because this proposed action to rip up a brand new		1884540	1890060
	1890	1896	cycleway would this be at ratepayer cost? Is this the most appropriate use of		1890060	1896140
	1896	1902	ratepayer money? The Peninsulas Action Group have serious concerns that if		1896140	1902300
	1902	1908	approved the destruction of in situ infrastructure will create a precedent		1902300	1908380
	1908	1914	alluded to by the President of Bicycle New South Wales that would jeopardize		1908380	1913780
	1914	1919	future delivery of infrastructure programs of work designed to		1913780	1919380
	1919	1927	benefit the whole of Canada Bay Council community. As we've pointed out above the		1919380	1926500
	1927	1932	proposed removal of the Heath Street cycleway link is in direct contradiction		1926500	1932380
	1932	1941	to Council's well documented strategy for active transport for our local		1932380	1940500
	1941	1946	communities and any proposed removal of this link must be considered		1940500	1946100
	1946	1952	holistically and not in isolation due to the ripple effects it could have the		1946100	1952100
	1952	1959	removal could have on the very future of active transport across the LGA. Finally		1952100	1959260
	1959	1965	we would ask that you please please put the safety and amenity of all		1959260	1965220
	1965	1972	constituents front of mind when considering this proposal for destruction		1965220	1971820
	1972	1980	of crucial funded completed and importantly embraced in situ		1971820	1980300
	1980	1986	infrastructure when we ask that you please do not approve this proposal.		1980300	1986060
	1986	1989	Thank you.		1986060	1988860
	1989	1999	Thank you. Next speaker Ross Butler please.		1988860	1999340
	2004	2011	Good evening Mayor and Councillors. Thank you for the opportunity to come here this evening to talk about		2004340	2010540
	2011	2017	Heath Street and Heath Street alone. If John's still here I'd like to just		2010540	2016620
	2017	2023	recognize that I'm probably one of those retirees John. Okay I'm here this evening		2016620	2022940
	2023	2028	and I believe I represent the overwhelming opinion of residents in and		2022940	2028260
	2028	2034	around Heath Street Rod Point to support the 16th of March Council's Local		2028260	2033900
	2034	2040	Traffic Committee meeting recommendation that the separated cycleway in Heath		2033900	2040020
	2040	2045	Street be removed and replaced with a two-way mixed traffic arrangement set		2040020	2045240
	2045	2051	out in the Council's draft design modification proposal on 23rd January 2023.		2045240	2051140
	2051	2056	There seems to be some confusion here tonight about the cycleway going away		2051140	2056220
	2056	2060	from Heath Street. The cycleway is not going away from Heath Street. The cycleway		2056220	2059980
	2060	2065	is going to remain in Heath Street. What is going to be removed is the cycle		2059980	2065460
	2065	2072	pathway and the concrete blocks in the middle of the road. In addition to		2065460	2072060
	2072	2076	be explained I'm requesting that Councillors consider further modifications		2072060	2076100
	2076	2081	that not only respond to residents concerns but are common-sense changes		2076100	2081420
	2081	2086	that make the cycleway more practical and provide workable arrangements to		2081420	2085740
	2086	2091	residents living in and around Heath Street. The routing of the East West		2085740	2091100
	2091	2096	cycleway by Heath Street has been the cause of great concern to residents		2091100	2095860
	2096	2102	living in and around Heath Street. Their concerns have to do with		2095860	2101820
	2102	2108	"safety, the well-being of pedestrian cyclists and motorists, social harmony and"		2101820	2107740
	2108	2114	resident amenity. There is evidence and many well-formed arguments as to why		2107740	2114260
	2114	2119	Heath Street is an inappropriate choice of a cycleway. It has been demonstrated		2114260	2119220
	2119	2124	"that this has resulted from non-existing research, poor planning,"		2119220	2123500
	2124	2129	limited implementation and a significant lack of community consultation.		2123500	2128980
	2129	2134	However in the hope that there has been learning from the errors of the past and		2128980	2134420
	2134	2141	in the spirit of goodwill is time to put these events behind us and to		2134420	2140540
	2141	2145	make the most of the circumstances that are before us and to ensure that the		2140540	2144700
	2145	2149	usage of Heath Street and the accompanying infrastructure is best fit		2144700	2148700
	2149	2153	for purpose and that resident concerns are addressed in the most effective and		2148700	2152620
	2153	2160	practical ways. It's been said before residents are the subject matter experts.		2152620	2159740
	2160	2166	That is my neighbors and I in and around Heath Street are cognizant of activities		2159740	2165940
	2166	2170	in in Heath Street and surrounding streets in terms of the uses of the		2165940	2170340
	2170	2176	"streets, about traffic movements, about the good and the bad and about how the"		2170340	2175620
	2176	2183	overall area functions.		2175620	2182620
	2193	2199	"We observe as we go about our daily lives people going for walks, exercising"		2193020	2198900
	2199	2205	"their dogs, mothers with prams, how many cyclists use a cycleway, traffic at its"		2198900	2205060
	2205	2210	"heaviest and at its lightest, when and how vehicles have difficulty to navigate"		2205060	2209700
	2210	2215	"the island refuges, when cars are speeding, when people practice golf or"		2209700	2215020
	2215	2219	"fly drones in Timberlake Park, what the impact on the area is when Timberlake"		2215020	2219380
	2219	2223	Park is in heavy use and when there are other		2219380	2223100
	2223	2228	activities and incidents acceptable or not take place throughout the day and		2223100	2227700
	2228	2234	"night. With all due respect to council employees, cyclists and those who live"		2227700	2233820
	2234	2238	"away from the area, they cannot fully appreciate and comprehend the whole"		2233820	2238100
	2238	2244	picture of Heath Street and the surrounding area. Reference to		2238100	2243980
	2244	2251	"Google Maps, spot visits or a 30 second cycle traverse through the area"		2243980	2250780
	2251	2256	only provides a snapshot and a possible distorted view. Hence the warranted		2250780	2256260
	2256	2261	"distress, outrage and sense of disrespect that residents have felt as they were"		2256260	2261340
	2261	2266	not appropriately consulted in relation to usage of Heath Street for the cycleway.		2261340	2266060
	2266	2272	"For example, it's now become obvious to everybody that those who decide that"		2266060	2272060
	2272	2277	Heath Street was an appropriate route for the cycleway had no idea of what		2272060	2277060
	2277	2282	happens in terms of parking and motorist behavior when there is a significant		2277060	2281500
	2282	2287	sporting event in Timberlake Park. If the planners of the cycleway had an inkling		2281500	2286860
	2287	2290	"of what occurs at those times, Heath Street would have been immediately"		2286860	2290380
	2290	2297	"ruled out. Councillors De Pasquay, Little and Megner all have witnessed the chaos"		2290380	2296620
	2297	2301	"to which I'm referring along with the new director, some of his staff and the"		2296620	2301420
	2301	2309	former acting director. Before moving to the further modifications that I		2301420	2309180
	2309	2313	"will request, I wish to acknowledge the involvement and interest of the mayor and"		2309180	2312900
	2313	2317	councillors in the concerns of residents and the willingness of the		2312900	2317060
	2317	2321	new director and former acting director to listen and absorb resident feedback		2317060	2321260
	2321	2326	"that has been fed into the proposal, proposed modifications recommended by"		2321260	2325900
	2326	2331	"the local traffic committee. Further, it was a welcome move by council engaging"		2325900	2331060
	2331	2334	"the professional experts. Mr Butler, I'm nearly finished, I'll give you an extension."		2331060	2334460
	2334	2338	"Could I have an extension? No, put it in the move in a second and I'll put it all those"		2334460	2337660
	2338	2342	"in the face, say aye. The ayes have it. Engaging the professional, engaging the"		2337660	2342460
	2342	2347	"professional experts, McLaren traffic engineering who identified and confirmed"		2342460	2346500
	2347	2351	the residents fears relating to safety in Heath Street that has prompted the now		2346500	2351100
	2351	2357	"proposed modifications. Also, residents are awaiting the Timbrel Park parking"		2351100	2357080
	2357	2360	and pedestrian study. This leads me to the matters to which I request		2357080	2360340
	2360	2365	councillors give further consideration. The issue of the availability of		2360340	2365220
	2365	2369	parking brought into focus by implementation of the cycleway has not		2365220	2369220
	2369	2373	been satisfactorily resolved and it appears it will continue to be a		2369220	2372980
	2373	2377	significant inconvenience and source of anxiety for residents in Heath Street		2372980	2376900
	2377	2383	and nearby. Currently the cycleway features island refuges in Heath Street		2376900	2382580
	2383	2387	Henley Marine Drive that many have described as gross over-engineering and		2382580	2387180
	2387	2392	a very clumsy solution to the impracticability of routing the cycleway		2387180	2392340
	2392	2397	via Heath Street and Timbrel Park. These refuges have brought about the removal		2392340	2396820
	2397	2401	of a number of parking spots creating parking pressure that becomes all too		2396820	2400700
	2401	2404	obvious when there's a sporting events or other activities in Timbrel Park or		2400700	2404420
	2404	2408	"people are parked so as to complete a circuit of the bay run. In addition,"		2404420	2408320
	2408	2412	residents who have lived in the area for many years can no longer freely park		2408320	2411500
	2412	2415	their cars close to their properties as has been their habit without risking		2411500	2415420
	2415	2420	penalty resulting in a situation often where there's no available parking spaces		2415420	2419620
	2420	2424	in close proximity. It is claimed by council that the refuges islands are in the		2419620	2424420
	2424	2429	necessary safety feature of the cycleway and they may well be that if they were		2424420	2429400
	2429	2434	used. For cyclists the refuges represent a roundabout means to traverse from		2429400	2433900
	2434	2438	Heath Street across Henley Marine Drive and vice versa. While for pedestrians		2433900	2438220
	2438	2442	there has never been and there still isn't any difficulty to cross safely		2438220	2442020
	2442	2446	either Heath Street or Henley Marine Drive. Any casual observation verifies		2442020	2446180
	2446	2450	that cyclists do not use the refuges travelling either north or south and		2446180	2449540
	2450	2454	pedestrians will cross the roads as they please and not divert their journey to		2449540	2453700
	2454	2458	use the refuge islands. At the moment it appears an intent of the refuge		2453700	2457940
	2458	2462	islands to remain on the very speculative belief that cyclists and		2457940	2461940
	2462	2465	pedestrians will use them in due course without any evidence to support that		2461940	2465460
	2465	2470	supposition. Meanwhile local residents will continue to be unnecessarily		2465460	2469700
	2470	2473	deprived of a degree of convenience for their daily lives and potentially the		2469700	2473260
	2473	2480	islands will be in place virtually forever never been used. So my request to		2473260	2479580
	2480	2483	councils to address the significant parking problems that exist in Heath		2479580	2482740
	2483	2487	Street and surrounding areas is the refuge islands being removed. Should the		2482740	2486820
	2487	2491	cycleway using Heath Street actually ever attract critical mass which many doubt		2486820	2491300
	2491	2496	then perhaps a need may arise for some reassessment. Council is further		2491300	2495940
	2496	2500	requested to consider that certain areas be made available for resident parking		2495940	2499580
	2500	2503	only to affect some balance in the uses of the diminished availability of on		2499580	2503460
	2503	2509	street parking. The fact that council has a commissioned a specific study to look		2503460	2508620
	2509	2512	at parking and pedestrians in the context of Tintrell Park demonstrates		2508620	2512060
	2512	2516	that resident concerns in relation to parking have been recognized as genuine		2512060	2516020
	2516	2521	and substantial. Removal of the island refuges and and or dedicated resident		2516020	2520940
	2521	2526	parking spaces are practical and realistic solutions to a situation that		2520940	2525500
	2526	2531	has developed over time exacerbated and emphasized by the by the cycleway in		2525500	2530740
	2531	2535	Heath Street. I'm looking for your support councils and thanks for the time.		2530740	2535260
	2535	2548	Thank you. And I think that that you referred to a traffic and pedestrian		2535260	2547540
	2548	2554	study that is occurring also a plan of management for Tintrell Park so they all		2547540	2553780
	2554	2561	into we've together to consider the options that may improve the parking and		2553780	2561220
	2561	2568	speeding and so forth the around that area but thank you Mr. Butler can I ask		2561220	2567700
	2568	2580	Maria Capesio to come up please. Thank you Mr. Mayor and councillors I don't have a		2567700	2580060
	2580	2586	fancy speech that most of these people have written I'm just here representing		2580060	2585980
	2586	2591	the residents of Heath Street because I am a resident of the street that has		2585980	2590500
	2591	2595	been severely impacted since the cycleway has been implemented. I do		2590500	2595460
	2595	2602	firstly want to stress that the residents are not anti cyclists we are		2595460	2602260
	2602	2612	not anti cycleways we just want a safer environment for everybody residents the		2602260	2611540
	2612	2617	cyclists motorists and since the implementation of the cycleway in our		2611540	2617060
	2617	2625	street it has become extremely unsafe with already a cyclist landing on a car		2617060	2625100
	2625	2632	we've already had that accident we have had close calls where my children have		2625100	2631580
	2632	2638	almost been hit by vehicles traveling up Heath Street we have had elderly		2631580	2638380
	2638	2643	residents who have been exiting their vehicles and tripping over the concrete		2638380	2642740
	2643	2648	bollards in that street and damaging and you know getting severe injuries from		2642740	2648260
	2648	2659	that what we want to see is a more safer street for everybody that's there now		2648260	2658540
	2659	2665	since the implementation and you know cyclists don't understand what the		2658540	2665340
	2665	2672	struggles are for us every day because they are not there every day day in day		2665340	2671820
	2672	2678	out leaving the street multiple times a day like myself and like several other		2671820	2677980
	2678	2684	residents prior to the cycleway being implemented we didn't have any problems		2677980	2684380
	2684	2690	there was no issues we didn't write into the council to say hey you know I can't		2684380	2690340
	2690	2697	get out of my driveway or there wasn't any cycling accidents at all but since		2690340	2697460
	2697	2702	the implementation where there have been several difficulties that are		2697460	2702260
	2702	2711	concerning mainly safety now when exiting my driveway for example I can see		2702260	2710780
	2711	2719	the cyclists coming up but once I pass that small strip of road I am blind and		2710780	2719020
	2719	2725	yesterday I almost hit a cyclist who was coming down Heath Street because I could		2719020	2725020
	2725	2731	not see him at all prior to the cycleway I had plenty of room where I could see		2725020	2731060
	2731	2736	because the cars are parked along the curb now cars are parked virtually like		2731060	2735940
	2736	2741	in the middle of the road so I have to go out further and by the time I have my		2735940	2740860
	2741	2747	line of sight it is too late and luckily for this cyclist he wasn't traveling		2740860	2747140
	2747	2753	down at the speed of light which majority of them do down Heath Street we		2747140	2752780
	2753	2759	didn't have a collision also this cycleway is extremely dangerous because		2752780	2759260
	2759	2766	children come down that cycleway the wrong way it is meant for uphill they		2759260	2766020
	2766	2773	come downhill they do not stop they do not slow down they do not look and they		2766020	2772620
	2773	2778	just fly down there because it's fun then they get to the Heath Street		2772620	2777700
	2778	2786	intersection and thank God there has not been an accident or a fatality but if		2777700	2785700
	2786	2795	there is one in the making so I shared space on that road removal of that		2785700	2794980
	2795	2800	cycleway and making it a shared space and perhaps reducing the speed limit to		2794980	2800460
	2800	2808	30 k's an hour to really slow down the cars will make it much better we have		2800460	2807860
	2808	2815	also experienced and this is something I really wanted to make light of is since		2807860	2814620
	2815	2822	the meeting that we had back in February some cyclists in some of these		2814620	2821700
	2822	2829	organizations have been inciting their members to use Heath Street purposely		2821700	2828900
	2829	2835	then they come up the street when we are outside we are perhaps walking our dogs		2828900	2834980
	2835	2841	mowing our grass tending to our garden and these cyclists would then slow down		2834980	2840500
	2841	2850	or stop and verbally abuse us for no reason which is unacceptable because we		2840500	2849980
	2850	2856	are not against the cyclists we're just against the design of this cycleway		2849980	2856380
	2856	2861	because it is extremely unsafe and it's not fair that they cyclists think it's		2856380	2861380
	2861	2869	their right to abuse us when we're there where we've got their best interests at		2861380	2868860
	2869	2875	heart so I plead with all of you councillors to take into consideration		2868860	2875340
	2875	2881	that safety is the most important thing here for everybody it's got nothing to		2875340	2881140
	2881	2887	do with the cycle route from here to wherever it's got to do with making sure		2881140	2887260
	2887	2894	everyone who uses a road is safe and not going to get hurt		2887260	2894020
	2894	2898	no I'm fine thank you very much		2894020	2898140
	2901	2907	I think this might be the last speaker on this item Joey Proppiano please same		2900940	2907140
	2907	2914	thing you don't need to speak you're a resident of the street so you say		2907140	2913900
	2914	2922	what's up to you I'm not forcing it's up to you if you want to take the		2913900	2921920
	2925	2934	I'm also a Heath Street resident but I'm also a bike enthusiast as well which I		2924660	2934300
	2934	2940	ride my bike quite a lot and what I want to take into consideration is that we've		2934300	2940380
	2940	2947	heard the bike users talk about me me me and it's the impact but us residents		2940380	2947180
	2947	2953	are saying it's about everybody how everybody's impacted not just the I		2947180	2952500
	2953	2959	suppose the 1% of the traffic that goes up that street per day where you know		2952500	2958620
	2959	2962	the 99.9% I should say are people going to the parks going to the		2958620	2961940
	2962	2968	Bay Run going to their houses or walking their dogs so you know further		2961940	2967940
	2968	2975	testament to that I am a bike enthusiast is that the Canada Bay		2967940	2974820
	2975	2981	bicycle user group Bay Rugged Bay Bug Forum which despite the low number of		2974820	2980820
	2981	2990	73 followers I thank them for posting an article on February 19th February 19th		2980820	2989660
	2990	2996	this year from real estate comm where I talk about how bicycle lanes and can		2989660	2996420
	2996	3001	actually improve the value of people's homes if they're done correctly so I'm		2996420	3001340
	3001	3007	not even a resident I'm in favor of bait bicycle lanes and but I can simply say		3001340	3007020
	3007	3014	the lanes that we have at Heath Street are completely unsafe where I live I'm		3007020	3013620
	3014	3021	exposed to pretty much all of Timble Park and Heath Street so wraps around		3013620	3021260
	3021	3029	the amount of times I've seen people kids Monday Tuesday I think Wednesday as		3021260	3029300
	3029	3033	well there's touch football there's hundreds if not thousands of parents		3029300	3033060
	3033	3038	and kids crossing those roads when they come from the bicycle lane and then		3033060	3038060
	3038	3044	there's a the the cars park they stick their heads out it's so narrow there's		3038060	3044180
	3044	3049	just no room for a mistake and I think the council's really gonna take that in		3044180	3048980
	3049	3056	consideration I'm not too sure but if I built a concrete block like that on my		3048980	3055980
	3056	3061	in my house I think I wouldn't get approved it would be trip hazard because		3055980	3061380
	3061	3066	I've honestly witnessed more and this is no this is fact I've actually seen		3061380	3066220
	3066	3071	people trip over those concrete blocks more than I've seen bikes use that bike		3066220	3071260
	3071	3076	track so I don't know where he got those figures from where the amount of bikes		3071260	3075700
	3076	3080	go up and down Heath Street but I think he's somewhat confused with those		3075700	3080180
	3080	3083	numbers		3080180	3082540
	3088	3093	Heath Street was a beautiful wide safe street which has now become a narrow		3088140	3092940
	3093	3097	confusing and unsafe Street you only have to go to barn staple streets the		3092940	3097340
	3097	3102	end of the street to see how it should be done the way that it's been designed		3097340	3101580
	3102	3106	there you don't have to look too far at all the new proposal for the council I		3101580	3106220
	3106	3112	believe is a win-win for everyone and I plead with the bike people stop worrying		3106220	3111900
	3112	3117	about yourself and worrying about the whole community because it's about		3111900	3117060
	3117	3127	everybody being safe not just the bikes everything else I think Maria and and		3117060	3126700
	3127	3131	Ross did a great job summarizing I sort of want to leave that out but I suppose		3126700	3131260
	3131	3137	while I'm here the council can come back and get all the spray paint markings off		3131260	3137340
	3137	3144	the off the footpaths that'd be a great idea as well thanks for that		3137340	3143860
	3144	3151	there are no speakers on the item a further speaker sorry no further		3143860	3150780
	3151	3157	speaks I'll give the opportunity for the chairman of the committee of traffic as		3150780	3156700
	3157	3166	the chair mr. council Meghna what do you want to do with this one thank you mr.		3156700	3165940
	3166	3175	mayor as mr. Butler said quite a few councillors or three at least have been		3165940	3174540
	3175	3179	down there and witnessed everything in real time the problems that are		3174540	3178700
	3179	3185	happening down there it is a shared space it's not just cyclists motorists		3178700	3185060
	3185	3193	and do something all right look I move the recommendation what I'll do I'll		3185060	3193420
	3193	3198	just add to it as well I'll move the recommendation of the traffic		3193420	3197580
	3198	3203	committee in this regard but also I'm sorry I was writing it out so I've		3197580	3202900

	3266	3279	thank you mr. mayor I'd like to move an amendment that we accept the council		3266220	3278680
	3279	3283	accept the city assets recommendations except for this Heath Street cycleway		3278680	3282860
	3283	3288	pending a further report to council following development of an improved		3282860	3287500
	3288	3292	concept design in conjunction with transport for New South Wales and		3287500	3292300
	3292	3302	bicycle New South Wales pending okay look you're trying to extend the time		3292300	3301620
	3302	3309	lapse on to carrying out the work pending for the study is the mover and		3301620	3308860
	3309	3313	the second I'm really happy with accepting second already known mr.		3308860	3313420
	3313	3319	man I'm sorry I've lived through this for quite a few months		3313420	3318820
	3319	3328	is that what any of the council's like to second my amendment so we can speak		3318820	3327780
	3328	3342	to it would be good have you got up there all right so count of Jago is		3327780	3342060
	3342	3352	point numbers is that your whole one two three this is what your amendment is one		3342060	3352340
	3352	3360	two three right that's what he's it's not quite the same hang on that's what		3352340	3359540
	3360	3362	you got that		3359540	3362380
	3366	3372	that'll do enough so as we accept it do we have a seconder if it doesn't get a		3365940	3371940
	3372	3377	seconder it lapses please accept how it actually debated I think it's worthy of		3371940	3376500
	3377	3384	debate one two three laps all right all right sorry		3376500	3384020
	3384	3388	council Jago there's no support on the floor for that to be debated so it		3384020	3388460
	3388	3394	stands the motion as moved and second and that's what we're debating if you		3388460	3394380
	3394	3399	want to speak against it you can speak against it so I'll ask someone that		3394380	3399420
	3399	3404	doesn't want to would like to speak against the motion before us		3399420	3404460
	3404	3409	against it thank you		3404460	3408820
	3415	3423	I'd like to first of all acknowledge the really strong experience on both sides		3415060	3422580
	3423	3429	of this debate okay can you talk to the chair not to the audience it's not I		3422580	3428700
	3429	3438	support that experience mr. mayor I do at the same time we have to acknowledge		3428700	3437700
	3438	3444	there is a diversity of views here and when we have that notorious socialist		3437700	3443580
	3444	3449	organization transport for New South Wales saying that's not they don't agree		3443580	3448820
	3449	3457	with this approach proposal I think it's worthy of examination so we certainly		3448820	3456620
	3457	3462	have concerns from the cyclists because you know once that separated cycleway		3456620	3462260
	3462	3467	is taken out then they're in greater danger and lives are at risk on the other		3462260	3466940
	3467	3473	hand we have legitimate concerns from the residents but their response I		3466940	3473220
	3473	3478	believe is to throw out the baby with the bathwater and and I won't mention		3473220	3477860
	3478	3482	the council expense we're talking about safety here but let's stop and think		3477860	3482300
	3482	3487	about it let's stop and think about it we've got the offer of real expertise		3482300	3487100
	3487	3493	and let's isolate the specific issues that are going on here we've we've got		3487100	3493460
	3493	3497	an offer from transport for New South Wales to actually help us work it		3493460	3497140
	3497	3503	through bicycle New South Wales have made the same offer and in fact the CEO		3497140	3502580
	3503	3509	called me and made that offer and that's open there is enormous expertise out		3502580	3508580
	3509	3517	there and we simply go with what will be a dumbed down response excuse me then		3508580	3516580
	3517	3525	that's not where we need to be let's apply an intelligent response that gets		3516580	3524500
	3525	3531	the maximum out of it instead of in the jerk reaction and that's why I say let's		3524500	3531220
	3531	3536	let's do it properly let's not do it half-assed excuse me let's do it		3531220	3536340
	3536	3547	properly take the offer okay before we move on have we had any incident report		3536340	3547140
	3547	3552	reports to council about matters down there at history		3547140	3552100
	3558	3563	three mr. mayor there's two insurance claims and another incident which I		3558140	3562580
	3563	3568	think was referred to earlier as an accident that we were aware of prior to		3562580	3568340
	3568	3577	that were any incident reports for Heath Street on record that we know no		3568340	3576620
	3577	3583	okay all right um council Megner sorry I'll ask for any speakers for them the		3576620	3583100
	3583	3599	motion is a second wish to speak to it mr. mayor sometimes things don't go our		3583100	3598860
	3599	3604	way or there has there is unintended consequences certainly the insurance		3598860	3604300
	3604	3611	claims and liability and trip hazards those unintended consequences and no		3604300	3610660
	3611	3616	amount of compensation will give back a someone who loses a family member		3610660	3616300
	3616	3627	because of an accident because of blind spots I appreciate the funding may		3616300	3626860
	3627	3634	involve some clawback potentially but I think we've got a proceed with the		3626860	3634140
	3634	3643	recommendation thank you any councillors that would like to speak on this item		3634140	3642660
	3643	3649	councilor Gordaro thank you mr. mayor just in brief look I can sense it the		3642660	3649300
	3649	3653	prevailing attitude here amongst all members who have come to speak tonight		3649300	3653300
	3653	3660	in the community the greater communities that they do support cycleways and that		3653300	3660260
	3660	3666	we and there is an acknowledgement that cars and bicycles need to share roads I		3660260	3665540
	3666	3673	can't imagine how blocks placed on a street that are 300 or 400 millimeters		3665540	3672860
	3673	3679	above ground level can ever be safe that gives license to cyclists to you know		3672860	3678580
	3679	3683	travel at 30 40 kilometers an hour along there I live on a stretch of road in		3678580	3683340
	3683	3689	Des Moines Wrights Road and Renwick Street that has safe bike transit going		3683340	3689420
	3689	3696	through it without such a cycle lanes constructed in Heath Street and I think		3689420	3695660
	3696	3700	there are other solutions and I can't see that deferring this for further		3695660	3700060
	3700	3704	consultation will actually come up with a solution that involves leaving the		3700060	3704060
	3704	3716	blocks with our speakers council make no further just sum up I think we've got a		3704060	3716180
	3716	3721	responsibility to the residents the safety of residents and the safety of		3716180	3720900
	3721	3727	cyclists both because there have been accidents there could be other		3720900	3727340
	3727	3733	accidents I have been down there when there have been near misses it isn't		3727340	3732500
	3733	3736	safe the way it is we're not throwing the baby out with the bath water as some		3732500	3735900
	3736	3742	people have said it is a very small street in a very large network and		3735900	3742100
	3742	3749	councillors have a long-standing history of supporting cycle networks we're not		3742100	3748900
	3749	3754	throwing the baby out with a bath water cyclists also have to be aware that		3748900	3754220
	3754	3759	there are pedestrians and cars around it's not just used for cyclists and		3754220	3758660
	3759	3765	while we've got all the bodies here can you tell your cyclists who speed down		3758660	3764700
	3765	3769	Henry Street and don't stop at great North Road where it says cyclists		3764700	3769460
	3769	3775	dismount and they speed across how many new missus I've seen knocking		3769460	3774700
	3775	3779	pedestrians over knocking little old ladies and swearing at little old ladies		3774700	3779060
	3779	3785	because they got in the way of cyclists and I've said to a few of them why don't		3779060	3785180
	3785	3789	you get off your bike because it says cyclists dismount oh it cuts into our		3785180	3788540
	3789	3793	into our time well it's not a race it's not a marathon it's not the Grand Prix		3788540	3793380
	3793	3799	of cyclists they have to be responsible for their own safety one has fallen off		3793380	3798740
	3799	3807	because he skidded so fast the same can happen here in Heath Street just to		3798740	3806980
	3807	3812	round it into Heath Street we're looking at a mentality and we're looking at		3806980	3812140
	3812	3817	safety the safety is paramount for the cyclists and for the pedestrians and for		3812140	3817220
	3817	3822	the residents coming out of their car driving out of their their driveways I		3817220	3821900
	3822	3827	think the recommendation is a suitable recommendation and is taking into		3821900	3827340
	3827	3833	consideration everyone's welfare okay close the debate I'm now going to put it		3827340	3832860
