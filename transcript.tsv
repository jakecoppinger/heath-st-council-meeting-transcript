0	9360	So I'm going to move on with the other item that has speakers listed and that is the item on the	
10080	17440	traffic committee of 10.1. So I suppose we should open the traffic committee.	
17440	19760	Oh no we'll hear the public forum first then we can do it.	
19760	31920	Yep okay this is to do with the cycleway in Heath Street so just if I call your name out	
31920	35520	put your hand up so I know you're here. Ralph? Rula? Ralph?	
38640	42400	David Martin? Yes. Francis O'Neill?	
42400	49200	Michael? Mike? Mike Boonton is in? Thank you.	
50880	61040	You're against? Ross Butler? Annie? Xerib? Annie you're from Mortlake are you speaking on this	
61040	77520	Heath Street one are you? Yes we are.	
77520	80880	Sorry Mr there's a lot of audible conversation it's hard to hear people speak.	
80880	87600	If you need to speak anybody that's please we would like everybody to you know listen and	
87600	94800	hear what's going on so if you need to speak the door's there go for it. Once in here please	
95840	98080	respect the floor and the speakers.	
100720	106160	Yeah so yeah we're only dealing with a little 200 meter section of the bikeway we're not dealing	
106160	111840	with the whole lot. We're not going to speak about anything else because we've got a specific report	
111840	123600	to do with Heath Street.	
123600	129840	We're only going to speak about Heath Street tonight. We're not right and with Baybug if I	
129840	136640	might just wish to ask you please it's a number of your speakers here tonight.	
136640	143840	We'd love to hear everything you have to say but not three four five times so keep it nice and short	
143840	152480	keep it to the issue and that's Heath Street and we all want to try to create a better	
152480	157280	liveable area Canada Bay but we're not going to solve the whole problem of the cycleway	
157280	163760	here tonight. We're only going to speak about Heath Street so once you start going off about	
163760	169360	other cycleways we're going to stop you there. Only Heath Street tonight talking about 200 meters	
169360	174800	and that's what we'll hear about so if you can please keep to that that would be great.	
174800	181120	So we'll let you go on about it Heath Street but just don't keep repeating. So first speaker Ralph	
181120	200960	I apologize. Please accept my apologies. I understand what you mean. My name's pretty hard to pronounce.	
200960	214560	I've been Ralphed all my life. I'm a bit sensitive to it. Mr. Mayor and Councillor I'm speaking as a	
214560	220480	representative of the Canada Bay Bicycle User Group and first of all let me acknowledge that	
220480	227440	the concerns voiced by residents that led to the proposal to remove the cycleway are genuinely held	
227440	234160	beliefs and that they should be taken seriously. Each concern must be thoroughly evaluated	
234160	241280	in careful consideration be given to addressing them. To me council's proposal along with the	
241280	247600	consultant report that attempts to support it does none of that and represents a knee-jerk reaction	
248240	255600	to put the matter to bed in the most politically expedient way. As someone who uses my bike to	
255600	261440	commute do the grocery shopping and travel around some of the wonderful destinations around Greater	
261440	267520	Sydney I was very pleased last September to see what I believed to be the first section in Heath	
267520	275760	Street of the taxpayer funded Canada Bay Regional Cycleway actually completed. I've written that	
275760	282240	section by myself and with much less able riders in the 20 plus years before the cycleway was in	
282240	289200	place and always felt like a sitting duck while grinding slowly up the hill. Nearby streets are	
289200	295440	harder to climb or have more exposure to motor traffic. Heath Street with its combination of	
295440	302320	lower traffic volumes and easier climb has always been the natural choice for those who cycle from	
302320	310240	the Bayrun and Timberl Park towards Central Five Dock and beyond. I asked Professor Miad Saberi from	
310240	316560	the University of New South Wales on the bike traffic modelling he has done and he said that	
316560	325520	Heath Street accommodates between 94 and 100 to 185 cycling trips per weekday on average excluding	
325520	335760	weekends that means between 23,500 and 46,250 cycling trips per year. Those estimates were based	
335760	344560	on 2021 data. If you count in weekends the number is likely to exceed 50,000 trips per year. Those	
344560	351680	were his words not mine. I was gobsmacked when I discovered a few months later the council now	
351680	357760	proposes to remove what looked to me like a well thought out piece of infrastructure that finally	
357760	363600	takes into account the safety of all road users. There are hundreds of kilometers of separated	
363600	369120	cycleway throughout Sydney a significant proportion of which run through residential	
369120	374720	streets like Heath Street and to my knowledge they have not led to an increase of risk or hazard	
374720	381200	to any particular category of road user. In fact I understand the net effect has been to reduce	
381200	385520	the number and severity of crashes in the neighborhoods where they are located.	
387280	393040	So while trying to distill the gist of the Heath Street residents concerns it occurred to me that	
393040	399360	the main issue was a sudden change to the streetscape and I acknowledge that that can be very distressing.	
400640	405680	It must be stated that Heath Street is not the exclusive property of the residents that live there	
406400	412080	nor the Timberl Park sports people that park there on weekends and weeknights and certainly	
412080	418400	not the people who ride their bikes along there. Heath Street is there for all road users in New	
418400	423840	South Wales to use. Like the Land Act says streets are provided for the movement of people.	
425760	431760	When I bought my house in Corrie's Avenue 23 years ago I was never asked if I thought it was	
431760	438400	okay for motor traffic to increase by a factor of three nor was I asked if it was okay for the	
438400	444000	street to become so solidly parked out a lot of the time that I have to take much more care looking	
444000	453200	out for traffic when I drive my car out of the driveway. Yet that's what's happened and unlike	
453200	460160	the residents of Heath Street there was not one iota of consultation. Canada Bay's environmental	
460160	469360	strategy from 2020 forecasts a population to increase from 79,000 in 2018 to 120,000 by 2036.	
469360	476560	By my sums that's an increase of 52 percent in that time the strategy forecasts walking to increase	
476560	484080	to 20 percent and cycling to increase to five percent by 2036. The way we are headed it seems	
484080	489840	like those figures are way too ambitious while council has a track record they can be proud of	
489840	498240	putting down walking and cycling tracks in uncontested spaces in places like parks and	
498240	505760	foreshores they have great benefits for recreation. The same can't be said for making road space safe	
505760	511280	for kids to ride their bikes to school or mums and dads to ride to work or to do the shopping.	
512000	517200	For the strategic plan to have any chance of actually working active transport.	
517200	522720	Ralph do you need more time your five minutes is up? About 30 seconds. I'll put it all in place.	
522720	529280	I always have it declared. Thank you. Thank you. Where was I? For the strategic plan to have any	
529280	536080	chance to actually work active transport must be taken seriously otherwise we'll be seeing 52 percent	
536080	541760	more cars clogging our roads and taking up non-existent parking spaces. Finally I would	
541760	548880	like to remind councillors the regional cycleway is not for people like me who you see are confidently	
548880	554320	rising riding in traffic it's for those you don't see because they are justifiably scared to ride	
554320	560080	their bikes on the road. I therefore ask council that the removal be deferred for a trial period	
560560	567280	while specific concerns are investigated in partnership as offered by Transport for New	
567280	572720	South Wales experts. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak tonight. Thank you Ralph.	
572720	580480	Did Ralph bring you did he bring all the baby issues to the floor or do we need to hear another	
580480	585600	another one okay all right David Martin please.	
589120	594880	Thanks Mr Mayor, councillors, officers, ladies and gentlemen. I'll just reiterate that last point that	
594880	598240	we are really seeing a lot of people who are not really interested in the	
598240	603280	traffic and the safety of their vehicles. We want to see an improvement in streets in Canada Bay	
603280	608720	for people walking for children for families for young people and that's what's happened with this	
608720	614080	200 meters is we're getting people who wouldn't ride normally feeling safe that they're protected	
614080	620480	from traffic. I'm a parent a grandparent, ex-primary school teacher and I've got a 25 year career	
620480	626960	in transport including in road safety so I'm only saying that to give you a little bit of a	
626960	631680	I'm only saying that to demonstrate I've got some understanding of the issues related to here so I'm	
631680	636960	here to oppose the removal it's an excellent facility as Ralph says and we recognize that the	
636960	642480	residents have got strongly held concerns but I think we can offer a constructive way forward.	
643520	649120	I don't believe the evidence that's been put forward in the paper that's come to council with	
649120	652800	the recommendation to remove it. I don't think the evidence really stacks up and I think the	
652800	659280	significant thing we should note is the transport for New South Wales voted against the proposal to	
659280	664400	remove it. They're the experts in this area and they've voted against it and if you go through the	
666880	674400	I do. Transport technically and in terms of regional network and cycleways they've got a	
674400	678320	whole lot of guidelines they've got the I don't want to go on but yes of course they are.	
678320	686720	So there are six pages and they go through here if you've read the agenda item the six pages you'll	
686720	692240	see that they're refuting each of the points and I'll just make some of those look and the broader	
692240	698400	point is that the impetus for the removal of the cycleway comes from the fact that circumstances	
698400	705600	in the streets in the lovely area of Rudd Point have changed and people are having trouble adapting	
705600	709840	to it and they've got very upset. Some of the points the key points that have been raised in	
709840	717040	opposition is the reduced width of Heath Street it's with the cycleway from those concrete buffers	
717040	723200	to the curb 8.859 meters and they're saying oh you know they could be head-on collisions.	
723840	731120	Well my street in Fyfe Duc where I live it's 6.6 meters and the difference is something like that	
731120	737520	so transport says that it's not a problem it's very generous with compared with streets around	
738640	742960	Will Sydney and Fyfe Duc and in Rod Point too it's a very wide street	
744640	747600	we've coped with it in my street there are no head-ons	
749520	754960	people it's called the Yield Street if cars are coming together one must give way to the other	
754960	761600	you've got to duck in that's the way it works it's not that hard. Sight lines drivers leaving driveways	
761600	767680	yes it's it's changed transport says they've got to check for bicycles as they come out of their	
767680	773840	properties then go past the parked cars and check for traffic you've got to creep out that's the way	
773840	779200	you do it this is Sydney there's a lot of traffic there's a lot of um there's need to be careful	
779200	784720	things are changing. Heath and Rickard we need to investigate it because they're talking about the	
784720	791200	sight lines you may need to move the give way line you might need to put in some concrete curve	
791200	795920	extensions transport says it's it's fixable in fact all the problems that are raised	
796560	804000	can be fixed by it's transport management 101 the other thing too is is community engagement	
804000	809040	what we've done what council's done with this with the community consultation is invite everybody	
809040	814800	to throw in all their bits and pieces about what they like or don't like what's really	
814800	819600	going to happen now is the community's got to be engaged one-on-one if they see problems	
820160	825600	that they'd like to see resolved so it's a different model okay so there may be tweaks required	
825600	832320	to the concrete separators to you might need to get a driving instructor in to coach people	
832320	837840	about driving in and out that has happened that has happened in other places you've really got to	
837840	846480	you've really got to help people adapt to change the uh the external traffic engineer says remove	
846480	851280	the cycle way to be safer for all road users absolutely no consideration in that report	
852000	859120	of the safety of bicycle users and that separation uh gives and taking it out is going to deter	
859120	866560	people from riding bikes the officer's report fails to note that the majority of respondents	
866560	872560	to the community consultation oppose a removal this is really about the interest of a small group	
873360	879760	of agitated residents over the benefits of everybody else in canada bay might also draw	
879760	884240	attention to financial matters ripping it out council's going to have to pay for it	
884240	889360	uh and it may result in financial penalties from the state authorities and place future	
889360	895680	funding in jeopardy the state and federal fund funding sources really support much of the traffic	
895680	900720	management that we're introducing like the wombats and the refuges around the streets we can	
900720	905680	congratulate the council for getting that money because those funds are there but the waste is	
905680	910800	not a good look not a good look do you need extra time yes one minute please	
910800	918800	one minute all those in favor say aye say no no no i'm going please thank you okay	
921520	925520	so the way the waste is not a good look for council after concord oval and all the other issues that	
925520	932480	we've had um and i think the problems that it introduces with state funding is um is really	
932480	939120	we can avoid it we can avoid it um so transport for new south wales is often a problem and we	
939120	943760	we're not going to be able to do that so transport for new south wales is offering a joint reveal of	
943760	949840	the design to balance all user requirements and all user safety issues and we support council	
949840	955920	accepting that offer so i urge council is to frame a motion i ask that you frame a motion	
955920	960160	you've got to reject the recommendation from traffic committee and that'll be terrific or	
960160	964560	defer the decision pending the development in conjunction with transport for new south wales	
964560	971840	and the history that balances all user requirements and all user safety issues thank you thank you	
971840	979120	very much thank you miss martin can i ask for the next speaker please francis o'neill	
987840	994000	evening everyone um this will be short uh i'm francis o'neill from bicycle new south wales	
994000	1000960	uh peak body for active transport i want to thank canada bay council for the opportunity to support	
1001840	1008160	the excellent cycleway that's on the heath street when i rode it i thought wow you know this is	
1008160	1017520	generously wide it's wonderful um future planning sustainability active travel the distance between	
1017520	1024240	the school the oval we're all about getting kids and old people from eight to eighty riding and	
1024240	1031200	active the cycleway improves safety for vulnerable road users by being separated it therefore	
1031200	1037920	encourages the 48 interested but concerned people to take up bike riding road paint will never	
1037920	1047120	achieve this outcome um heath street's safe convenient direct it's attractive to use uh this	
1047120	1052960	is why after only four months the strava bike count is pretty high that was something ralph	
1052960	1060800	mentioned encouraging active transport to reduce congestion reach net zero and improve our health	
1060800	1067440	is why the heath street cycleway was built it's why we've got active transport plans sustainability	
1067440	1076080	future proofing etc okay yeah i won't be long stick to history yep yep this is heath street	
1076080	1083440	it's related because on the basis of those plans canada bay council demonstrated its commitment to	
1083440	1088800	active transport sustainability net zero and received seven million dollars new south wales	
1088800	1095360	government funding in good faith in good faith the last traffic committee minutes noted that	
1095360	1101840	heath street remains the most appropriate and strategic cycleway route along the paramounted	
1101840	1108320	to cbd corridor that's why it got the funding the last minutes also noted transport for new south	
1108320	1114160	wales has offered to review and improve the concept design as have bicycle new south wales	
1114160	1121440	as has canada bay bugs okay i'm almost finished we disagree however with the previous minutes	
1121440	1129200	noting that the removal of the cycleway will incur no additional cost okay firstly on two points	
1129200	1136320	canada bay is likely to be asked by transport for new south wales to refund the portion or all of	
1136320	1143440	the destroyed infrastructure spent secondly destruction of stage one risks the integrity	
1143440	1150400	of the whole seven million dollar project in all its six stages the other financial implication is	
1150400	1156640	that canada bay will be reviewed as an unreliable business partner for the many future transport	
1156640	1163280	for new south wales active transport projects in the pipeline this cycleway is only four months old	
1163280	1170560	and already doing so well so it lets everybody take a deep breath yeah just as it takes time to	
1170560	1178400	create something so it creates it takes a bit of time to destroy it time is your friend canada bay	
1178400	1184960	council time is your friend both sides agree this is where both sides agree consultation wasn't	
1184960	1192240	done right yeah okay so let's use the time wisely before you just rip it out because you might get	
1192240	1198080	it wrong you never know it is best practice on projects like this to bring the community	
1198080	1203760	on board through a process of co-design whereby stakeholders learn about the many benefits	
1204480	1211600	they get to air their concerns and get to shape the outcome it's advisable to consult with experts	
1211600	1219840	on co-design to ensure success because that runs on the board i have outlined some of the reputational	
1219840	1226640	and financial costs of trashing great infrastructure such as the heath street cycleway another cost is	
1227280	1234400	is that canada bay will gain a reputation of being a walkover among the anti-cycleway lobby	
1234400	1240000	making active transport projects that much harder to deliver you're creating a rod for your own back	
1240000	1246960	by making this decision so take some time think it through finally let's remember public roads	
1246960	1252160	are public roads and not the private property of residents who happen to live along them	
1252160	1271040	they are for the benefit of all road users	
1282160	1298720	um so again um a bit disappointed on you know bicycle new south wales taking that approach	
1298720	1312480	about canada bay mike bottle please uh president of baybug thank you	
1314080	1318240	good evening sir mayor councillors ladies and gentlemen thank you for the opportunity	
1318960	1325840	um as president of baybug i'm the elected representative our local area um bicycle users	
1325840	1330480	these are bicycle users of all ages their children cycling to school and local parks	
1330480	1337520	in mothers and fathers often with toddler seats attached and they're some of our senior citizens	
1337520	1342800	possibly with the electrical assistance to their bikes to help their mobility their commuters	
1342800	1349360	and their leisure riders many if not most of these bicycle users do not feel safe riding on our	
1349360	1355760	public roads i can say this with confidence because i'm in my role as president over the last five	
1355760	1361280	years i've met over 100 members who often express these concerns not only for themselves but for	
1361280	1368000	their spouses for their children and their parents all bicycle users under the law have the right to	
1368000	1372240	use our public roads we all understand the responsibility of our authorities to provide	
1372240	1377280	a safe road system for our motorists it's time that the same energy and expertise was put into	
1377280	1384800	designing safe access routes for bicycle users the separated cycleway the 200 meter uphill stretch	
1384800	1390720	in heath street provides that safe environment and marks a welcoming beginning to a shift in	
1390720	1396800	design thinking in canada bay and aligns us with progressive councils that have rolled out kilometers	
1396800	1403760	of separated cycleways to remove it and force riders to climb that hill at low speed potentially	
1403760	1410800	with impatient drivers behind them is to create a much more dangerous environment a view that is	
1410800	1416400	supported by transport for new south wales as ministered in the traffic committee meetings	
1417680	1422240	the recommendation by council officers to remove the separated cycleway was driven i believe by	
1422240	1430000	objections from residents of heat street understandable objections given the changes but	
1430000	1433920	and this prompted council to commission an independent report known as the mcclaren report	
1434960	1440080	for a brief period that report was available for viewing on the collaborate canada bay site and in	
1440080	1445520	reading it i failed to see any obvious connection from the data and observations noted to how the	
1445520	1450160	conclusions were reached i was particularly astonished by the summary which states and i	
1450160	1455840	quote the resultant works meaning the construction of the separated cycleway have generally reduced	
1455840	1464320	the safety of all users for all movements along along across and access via heat street end of	
1464320	1468800	quote surely no one could argue that the separated cycleway has reduced the safety	
1469600	1472720	of bicycle users compared to the alternative of riding on the road	
1474320	1482320	i've lived in first avenue some 30 meters from the corner of um heat street for 32 years and as a	
1482320	1486720	resident of first avenue i've welcomed the recent changes that have had significant calming effect	
1487200	1492800	on motor traffic vehicles and namely the speed humps and the raised crossing at heat street	
1493520	1498320	and which i'm sure the locals know like many of the residents of heat street who are claiming	
1498320	1503280	that it's more difficult now to back out of their driveways i too have to use extreme caution when	
1503280	1508720	backing into first avenue from my driveway the new traffic calming devices have improved that	
1508720	1515120	situation their speeds are now noticeably reduced in first avenue this too will surely be the effect	
1515120	1520480	in heat street as motorists become more accustomed to the narrowing and reduce their speed accordingly	
1521440	1527040	council has already acknowledged that speeds have reduced from an average of 48 kilometers an hour	
1527040	1534320	in heat street before the cycleway went in to now 44 kilometers as for the objection that the street	
1534320	1540480	is now too narrow to back into safely and an opinion supported by the mclaren report i ask	
1540480	1545520	by what measure even with the adjusted widths after construction of the separated cycleway the	
1545520	1554000	carriageway curb to curb distance of heat street is between 9.05 and 9.1 meters i've measured this	
1554800	1558960	with the exception of arthur street which is a busy through road i've measured all the other	
1558960	1564960	parallel streets in rod point and found they're all under eight meters more than a meter narrower	
1564960	1572640	than heath street so by what measure is it unsafe for heat street as it now conforms to the suburb	
1572640	1579600	norm in summary i ask that council move to defer the traffic committee recommendation to remove	
1579600	1584800	the cycleway pending a design review offered by transport for new south wales representative on	
1584800	1590160	the traffic committee and council's own traffic studies and the expressed intention to look at	
1590160	1596560	further traffic calming finally i ask all councillors here present to demonstrate their	
1596560	1602320	commitment to creating a safe safer streets for all users and to encourage active transport and a	
1602320	1607680	reduction in reliance on cars thereby reducing emissions by voting against the removal of the	
1607680	1614240	separated cycleway thank you thank you mr potten uh ross i want to ask you to come up yet because	
1614240	1620240	there's another speaker for the bay bugs i'll keep them in line so uh could i have angsirra please	
1621040	1626240	come up and address the council	
1626240	1631600	good evening mr mayor councillors my name is ann schwirb and i'm representing the peninsula's	
1631600	1638800	action group we are community advocate group and we work with council on a range of local concerns	
1638800	1645680	including transport traffic pedestrian safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety	
1645680	1652480	and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety and safety	
1652480	1676620	matters here today each council's action group consists of five Agenda 9	
1676620	1681520	if it was approved, will essentially dismember the Council's proposed	
1681520	1688380	corridor of active transport access that feeds directly into our peninsula	
1688380	1694320	communities and on to the farthest reaches of the LGA. The following are	
1694320	1699560	just a few of Council's plans and guidelines that rely on the retention of	
1699560	1705440	the Heath Street cycleway component as part of the overarching active transport	
1705440	1710940	strategy for the whole of the Canada Bay LGA. Document 1 is the City of Canada Bay	
1710940	1717560	Local Planning Strategy 2010-31 and we quote directly from that	
1717560	1724220	document which proposes the delivery of a new regional cycleway that connects	
1724220	1731460	western and eastern parts of the LGA and further the delivery of a	
1731460	1737940	regional bike route that links Sydney City and Sydney Olympic Park across the	
1737940	1744700	Canada Bay LGA. The second document that we refer to is the City of Sydney Canada	
1744700	1750740	Bay Bike Plan 2020 available on Council's website which states to develop in	
1750740	1759260	detail a core spinal cycleway network throughout the Canada Bay LGA and it	
1759260	1766660	goes on to say perhaps most importantly to enable people to cycle safely.	
1766660	1772820	Following the recent completion of the fantastic redevelopment of Concord Oval	
1772820	1780740	the proposed removal of the Heath Street cycleway link would mean many local	
1780740	1787300	families including children wishing to use active transport to attend this	
1787300	1795900	world-class venue would have no way of doing so safely. This brings us to refer	
1795900	1801300	to document 3 on Council's website which is the Concord Oval Precinct Management	
1801300	1807520	Plan which recommends within the document the development of cycleway	
1807520	1814300	connections to Concord Oval. Now there's the matter of the appropriate government	
1814300	1818620	use of government funding. The government funding for local infrastructure	
1818620	1824780	projects are generous gifts that benefit the whole of the Canada Bay community.	
1824780	1831180	These grants assist councils such as ours to achieve its vision for the	
1831180	1835980	amenity of local communities without the need to place additional	
1835980	1842340	financial burdens on local ratepayers. Crucially at this time when Council is	
1842340	1850420	proposing to raise council rates substantially. To now propose to rip up	
1850420	1856860	this frequently used and funded completed infrastructure we believe	
1856860	1862580	would certainly give the government as the President of Baybug has	
1862580	1869500	alluded to it would give the government pause when considering future grants for	
1869500	1877140	our LGA. This is even more important when we are aware that Transport for New South	
1877140	1884540	Wales has very very strenuously opposed the destruction of this infrastructure.	
1884540	1890060	We would now ask that because this proposed action to rip up a brand new	
1890060	1896140	cycleway would this be at ratepayer cost? Is this the most appropriate use of	
1896140	1902300	ratepayer money? The Peninsulas Action Group have serious concerns that if	
1902300	1908380	approved the destruction of in situ infrastructure will create a precedent	
1908380	1913780	alluded to by the President of Bicycle New South Wales that would jeopardize	
1913780	1919380	future delivery of infrastructure programs of work designed to	
1919380	1926500	benefit the whole of Canada Bay Council community. As we've pointed out above the	
1926500	1932380	proposed removal of the Heath Street cycleway link is in direct contradiction	
1932380	1940500	to Council's well documented strategy for active transport for our local	
1940500	1946100	communities and any proposed removal of this link must be considered	
1946100	1952100	holistically and not in isolation due to the ripple effects it could have the	
1952100	1959260	removal could have on the very future of active transport across the LGA. Finally	
1959260	1965220	we would ask that you please please put the safety and amenity of all	
1965220	1971820	constituents front of mind when considering this proposal for destruction	
1971820	1980300	of crucial funded completed and importantly embraced in situ	
1980300	1986060	infrastructure when we ask that you please do not approve this proposal.	
1986060	1988860	Thank you.	
1988860	1999340	Thank you. Next speaker Ross Butler please.	
2004340	2010540	Good evening Mayor and Councillors. Thank you for the opportunity to come here this evening to talk about	
2010540	2016620	Heath Street and Heath Street alone. If John's still here I'd like to just	
2016620	2022940	recognize that I'm probably one of those retirees John. Okay I'm here this evening	
2022940	2028260	and I believe I represent the overwhelming opinion of residents in and	
2028260	2033900	around Heath Street Rod Point to support the 16th of March Council's Local	
2033900	2040020	Traffic Committee meeting recommendation that the separated cycleway in Heath	
2040020	2045240	Street be removed and replaced with a two-way mixed traffic arrangement set	
2045240	2051140	out in the Council's draft design modification proposal on 23rd January 2023.	
2051140	2056220	There seems to be some confusion here tonight about the cycleway going away	
2056220	2059980	from Heath Street. The cycleway is not going away from Heath Street. The cycleway	
2059980	2065460	is going to remain in Heath Street. What is going to be removed is the cycle	
2065460	2072060	pathway and the concrete blocks in the middle of the road. In addition to	
2072060	2076100	be explained I'm requesting that Councillors consider further modifications	
2076100	2081420	that not only respond to residents concerns but are common-sense changes	
2081420	2085740	that make the cycleway more practical and provide workable arrangements to	
2085740	2091100	residents living in and around Heath Street. The routing of the East West	
2091100	2095860	cycleway by Heath Street has been the cause of great concern to residents	
2095860	2101820	living in and around Heath Street. Their concerns have to do with	
2101820	2107740	safety, the well-being of pedestrian cyclists and motorists, social harmony and	
2107740	2114260	resident amenity. There is evidence and many well-formed arguments as to why	
2114260	2119220	Heath Street is an inappropriate choice of a cycleway. It has been demonstrated	
2119220	2123500	that this has resulted from non-existing research, poor planning,	
2123500	2128980	limited implementation and a significant lack of community consultation.	
2128980	2134420	However in the hope that there has been learning from the errors of the past and	
2134420	2140540	in the spirit of goodwill is time to put these events behind us and to	
2140540	2144700	make the most of the circumstances that are before us and to ensure that the	
2144700	2148700	usage of Heath Street and the accompanying infrastructure is best fit	
2148700	2152620	for purpose and that resident concerns are addressed in the most effective and	
2152620	2159740	practical ways. It's been said before residents are the subject matter experts.	
2159740	2165940	That is my neighbors and I in and around Heath Street are cognizant of activities	
2165940	2170340	in in Heath Street and surrounding streets in terms of the uses of the	
2170340	2175620	streets, about traffic movements, about the good and the bad and about how the	
2175620	2182620	overall area functions.	
2193020	2198900	We observe as we go about our daily lives people going for walks, exercising	
2198900	2205060	their dogs, mothers with prams, how many cyclists use a cycleway, traffic at its	
2205060	2209700	heaviest and at its lightest, when and how vehicles have difficulty to navigate	
2209700	2215020	the island refuges, when cars are speeding, when people practice golf or	
2215020	2219380	fly drones in Timberlake Park, what the impact on the area is when Timberlake	
2219380	2223100	Park is in heavy use and when there are other	
2223100	2227700	activities and incidents acceptable or not take place throughout the day and	
2227700	2233820	night. With all due respect to council employees, cyclists and those who live	
2233820	2238100	away from the area, they cannot fully appreciate and comprehend the whole	
2238100	2243980	picture of Heath Street and the surrounding area. Reference to	
2243980	2250780	Google Maps, spot visits or a 30 second cycle traverse through the area	
2250780	2256260	only provides a snapshot and a possible distorted view. Hence the warranted	
2256260	2261340	distress, outrage and sense of disrespect that residents have felt as they were	
2261340	2266060	not appropriately consulted in relation to usage of Heath Street for the cycleway.	
2266060	2272060	For example, it's now become obvious to everybody that those who decide that	
2272060	2277060	Heath Street was an appropriate route for the cycleway had no idea of what	
2277060	2281500	happens in terms of parking and motorist behavior when there is a significant	
2281500	2286860	sporting event in Timberlake Park. If the planners of the cycleway had an inkling	
2286860	2290380	of what occurs at those times, Heath Street would have been immediately	
2290380	2296620	ruled out. Councillors De Pasquay, Little and Megner all have witnessed the chaos	
2296620	2301420	to which I'm referring along with the new director, some of his staff and the	
2301420	2309180	former acting director. Before moving to the further modifications that I	
2309180	2312900	will request, I wish to acknowledge the involvement and interest of the mayor and	
2312900	2317060	councillors in the concerns of residents and the willingness of the	
2317060	2321260	new director and former acting director to listen and absorb resident feedback	
2321260	2325900	that has been fed into the proposal, proposed modifications recommended by	
2325900	2331060	the local traffic committee. Further, it was a welcome move by council engaging	
2331060	2334460	the professional experts. Mr Butler, I'm nearly finished, I'll give you an extension.	
2334460	2337660	Could I have an extension? No, put it in the move in a second and I'll put it all those	
2337660	2342460	in the face, say aye. The ayes have it. Engaging the professional, engaging the	
2342460	2346500	professional experts, McLaren traffic engineering who identified and confirmed	
2346500	2351100	the residents fears relating to safety in Heath Street that has prompted the now	
2351100	2357080	proposed modifications. Also, residents are awaiting the Timbrel Park parking	
2357080	2360340	and pedestrian study. This leads me to the matters to which I request	
2360340	2365220	councillors give further consideration. The issue of the availability of	
2365220	2369220	parking brought into focus by implementation of the cycleway has not	
2369220	2372980	been satisfactorily resolved and it appears it will continue to be a	
2372980	2376900	significant inconvenience and source of anxiety for residents in Heath Street	
2376900	2382580	and nearby. Currently the cycleway features island refuges in Heath Street	
2382580	2387180	Henley Marine Drive that many have described as gross over-engineering and	
2387180	2392340	a very clumsy solution to the impracticability of routing the cycleway	
2392340	2396820	via Heath Street and Timbrel Park. These refuges have brought about the removal	
2396820	2400700	of a number of parking spots creating parking pressure that becomes all too	
2400700	2404420	obvious when there's a sporting events or other activities in Timbrel Park or	
2404420	2408320	people are parked so as to complete a circuit of the bay run. In addition,	
2408320	2411500	residents who have lived in the area for many years can no longer freely park	
2411500	2415420	their cars close to their properties as has been their habit without risking	
2415420	2419620	penalty resulting in a situation often where there's no available parking spaces	
2419620	2424420	in close proximity. It is claimed by council that the refuges islands are in the	
2424420	2429400	necessary safety feature of the cycleway and they may well be that if they were	
2429400	2433900	used. For cyclists the refuges represent a roundabout means to traverse from	
2433900	2438220	Heath Street across Henley Marine Drive and vice versa. While for pedestrians	
2438220	2442020	there has never been and there still isn't any difficulty to cross safely	
2442020	2446180	either Heath Street or Henley Marine Drive. Any casual observation verifies	
2446180	2449540	that cyclists do not use the refuges travelling either north or south and	
2449540	2453700	pedestrians will cross the roads as they please and not divert their journey to	
2453700	2457940	use the refuge islands. At the moment it appears an intent of the refuge	
2457940	2461940	islands to remain on the very speculative belief that cyclists and	
2461940	2465460	pedestrians will use them in due course without any evidence to support that	
2465460	2469700	supposition. Meanwhile local residents will continue to be unnecessarily	
2469700	2473260	deprived of a degree of convenience for their daily lives and potentially the	
2473260	2479580	islands will be in place virtually forever never been used. So my request to	
2479580	2482740	councils to address the significant parking problems that exist in Heath	
2482740	2486820	Street and surrounding areas is the refuge islands being removed. Should the	
2486820	2491300	cycleway using Heath Street actually ever attract critical mass which many doubt	
2491300	2495940	then perhaps a need may arise for some reassessment. Council is further	
2495940	2499580	requested to consider that certain areas be made available for resident parking	
2499580	2503460	only to affect some balance in the uses of the diminished availability of on	
2503460	2508620	street parking. The fact that council has a commissioned a specific study to look	
2508620	2512060	at parking and pedestrians in the context of Tintrell Park demonstrates	
2512060	2516020	that resident concerns in relation to parking have been recognized as genuine	
2516020	2520940	and substantial. Removal of the island refuges and and or dedicated resident	
2520940	2525500	parking spaces are practical and realistic solutions to a situation that	
2525500	2530740	has developed over time exacerbated and emphasized by the by the cycleway in	
2530740	2535260	Heath Street. I'm looking for your support councils and thanks for the time.	
2535260	2547540	Thank you. And I think that that you referred to a traffic and pedestrian	
2547540	2553780	study that is occurring also a plan of management for Tintrell Park so they all	
2553780	2561220	into we've together to consider the options that may improve the parking and	
2561220	2567700	speeding and so forth the around that area but thank you Mr. Butler can I ask	
2567700	2580060	Maria Capesio to come up please. Thank you Mr. Mayor and councillors I don't have a	
2580060	2585980	fancy speech that most of these people have written I'm just here representing	
2585980	2590500	the residents of Heath Street because I am a resident of the street that has	
2590500	2595460	been severely impacted since the cycleway has been implemented. I do	
2595460	2602260	firstly want to stress that the residents are not anti cyclists we are	
2602260	2611540	not anti cycleways we just want a safer environment for everybody residents the	
2611540	2617060	cyclists motorists and since the implementation of the cycleway in our	
2617060	2625100	street it has become extremely unsafe with already a cyclist landing on a car	
2625100	2631580	we've already had that accident we have had close calls where my children have	
2631580	2638380	almost been hit by vehicles traveling up Heath Street we have had elderly	
2638380	2642740	residents who have been exiting their vehicles and tripping over the concrete	
2642740	2648260	bollards in that street and damaging and you know getting severe injuries from	
2648260	2658540	that what we want to see is a more safer street for everybody that's there now	
2658540	2665340	since the implementation and you know cyclists don't understand what the	
2665340	2671820	struggles are for us every day because they are not there every day day in day	
2671820	2677980	out leaving the street multiple times a day like myself and like several other	
2677980	2684380	residents prior to the cycleway being implemented we didn't have any problems	
2684380	2690340	there was no issues we didn't write into the council to say hey you know I can't	
2690340	2697460	get out of my driveway or there wasn't any cycling accidents at all but since	
2697460	2702260	the implementation where there have been several difficulties that are	
2702260	2710780	concerning mainly safety now when exiting my driveway for example I can see	
2710780	2719020	the cyclists coming up but once I pass that small strip of road I am blind and	
2719020	2725020	yesterday I almost hit a cyclist who was coming down Heath Street because I could	
2725020	2731060	not see him at all prior to the cycleway I had plenty of room where I could see	
2731060	2735940	because the cars are parked along the curb now cars are parked virtually like	
2735940	2740860	in the middle of the road so I have to go out further and by the time I have my	
2740860	2747140	line of sight it is too late and luckily for this cyclist he wasn't traveling	
2747140	2752780	down at the speed of light which majority of them do down Heath Street we	
2752780	2759260	didn't have a collision also this cycleway is extremely dangerous because	
2759260	2766020	children come down that cycleway the wrong way it is meant for uphill they	
2766020	2772620	come downhill they do not stop they do not slow down they do not look and they	
2772620	2777700	just fly down there because it's fun then they get to the Heath Street	
2777700	2785700	intersection and thank God there has not been an accident or a fatality but if	
2785700	2794980	there is one in the making so I shared space on that road removal of that	
2794980	2800460	cycleway and making it a shared space and perhaps reducing the speed limit to	
2800460	2807860	30 k's an hour to really slow down the cars will make it much better we have	
2807860	2814620	also experienced and this is something I really wanted to make light of is since	
2814620	2821700	the meeting that we had back in February some cyclists in some of these	
2821700	2828900	organizations have been inciting their members to use Heath Street purposely	
2828900	2834980	then they come up the street when we are outside we are perhaps walking our dogs	
2834980	2840500	mowing our grass tending to our garden and these cyclists would then slow down	
2840500	2849980	or stop and verbally abuse us for no reason which is unacceptable because we	
2849980	2856380	are not against the cyclists we're just against the design of this cycleway	
2856380	2861380	because it is extremely unsafe and it's not fair that they cyclists think it's	
2861380	2868860	their right to abuse us when we're there where we've got their best interests at	
2868860	2875340	heart so I plead with all of you councillors to take into consideration	
2875340	2881140	that safety is the most important thing here for everybody it's got nothing to	
2881140	2887260	do with the cycle route from here to wherever it's got to do with making sure	
2887260	2894020	everyone who uses a road is safe and not going to get hurt	
2894020	2898140	no I'm fine thank you very much	
2900940	2907140	I think this might be the last speaker on this item Joey Proppiano please same	
2907140	2913900	thing you don't need to speak you're a resident of the street so you say	
2913900	2921920	what's up to you I'm not forcing it's up to you if you want to take the	
2924660	2934300	I'm also a Heath Street resident but I'm also a bike enthusiast as well which I	
2934300	2940380	ride my bike quite a lot and what I want to take into consideration is that we've	
2940380	2947180	heard the bike users talk about me me me and it's the impact but us residents	
2947180	2952500	are saying it's about everybody how everybody's impacted not just the I	
2952500	2958620	suppose the 1% of the traffic that goes up that street per day where you know	
2958620	2961940	the 99.9% I should say are people going to the parks going to the	
2961940	2967940	Bay Run going to their houses or walking their dogs so you know further	
2967940	2974820	testament to that I am a bike enthusiast is that the Canada Bay	
2974820	2980820	bicycle user group Bay Rugged Bay Bug Forum which despite the low number of	
2980820	2989660	73 followers I thank them for posting an article on February 19th February 19th	
2989660	2996420	this year from real estate comm where I talk about how bicycle lanes and can	
2996420	3001340	actually improve the value of people's homes if they're done correctly so I'm	
3001340	3007020	not even a resident I'm in favor of bait bicycle lanes and but I can simply say	
3007020	3013620	the lanes that we have at Heath Street are completely unsafe where I live I'm	
3013620	3021260	exposed to pretty much all of Timble Park and Heath Street so wraps around	
3021260	3029300	the amount of times I've seen people kids Monday Tuesday I think Wednesday as	
3029300	3033060	well there's touch football there's hundreds if not thousands of parents	
3033060	3038060	and kids crossing those roads when they come from the bicycle lane and then	
3038060	3044180	there's a the the cars park they stick their heads out it's so narrow there's	
3044180	3048980	just no room for a mistake and I think the council's really gonna take that in	
3048980	3055980	consideration I'm not too sure but if I built a concrete block like that on my	
3055980	3061380	in my house I think I wouldn't get approved it would be trip hazard because	
3061380	3066220	I've honestly witnessed more and this is no this is fact I've actually seen	
3066220	3071260	people trip over those concrete blocks more than I've seen bikes use that bike	
3071260	3075700	track so I don't know where he got those figures from where the amount of bikes	
3075700	3080180	go up and down Heath Street but I think he's somewhat confused with those	
3080180	3082540	numbers	
3088140	3092940	Heath Street was a beautiful wide safe street which has now become a narrow	
3092940	3097340	confusing and unsafe Street you only have to go to barn staple streets the	
3097340	3101580	end of the street to see how it should be done the way that it's been designed	
3101580	3106220	there you don't have to look too far at all the new proposal for the council I	
3106220	3111900	believe is a win-win for everyone and I plead with the bike people stop worrying	
3111900	3117060	about yourself and worrying about the whole community because it's about	
3117060	3126700	everybody being safe not just the bikes everything else I think Maria and and	
3126700	3131260	Ross did a great job summarizing I sort of want to leave that out but I suppose	
3131260	3137340	while I'm here the council can come back and get all the spray paint markings off	
3137340	3143860	the off the footpaths that'd be a great idea as well thanks for that	
3143860	3150780	there are no speakers on the item a further speaker sorry no further	
3150780	3156700	speaks I'll give the opportunity for the chairman of the committee of traffic as	
3156700	3165940	the chair mr. council Meghna what do you want to do with this one thank you mr.	
3165940	3174540	mayor as mr. Butler said quite a few councillors or three at least have been	
3174540	3178700	down there and witnessed everything in real time the problems that are	
3178700	3185060	happening down there it is a shared space it's not just cyclists motorists	
3185060	3193420	and do something all right look I move the recommendation what I'll do I'll	
3193420	3197580	just add to it as well I'll move the recommendation of the traffic	
3197580	3202900	committee in this regard but also I'm sorry I was writing it out so I've	
3202900	3207300	only got half a part of it here but further consideration and invest in	
3207300	3211940	investigative work be undertaken with regards to the traffic islands on the	
3211940	3217860	intersection of Henley Marine Drive and Heath Street and that the potential	
3217860	3223140	removal of traffic islands be presented to the traffic committee in future	
3223140	3228900	can that can that in court be incorporated with the traffic study that	
3228900	3232660	we're doing because they want to isolate something they're doing a traffic and	
3232660	3236220	pedestrian study and	
3242220	3245220	I'll just go with the recommendation sorry I'll just go with the	
3245220	3253060	recommendation you can put forward when they because it's not okay	
3253060	3257060	and that's it thank you I made a seconder	
3257060	3263780	council Z right anyone wish to speak against the recommendation councillor	
3263780	3266140	Jago	
3266220	3278680	thank you mr. mayor I'd like to move an amendment that we accept the council	
3278680	3282860	accept the city assets recommendations except for this Heath Street cycleway	
3282860	3287500	pending a further report to council following development of an improved	
3287500	3292300	concept design in conjunction with transport for New South Wales and	
3292300	3301620	bicycle New South Wales pending okay look you're trying to extend the time	
3301620	3308860	lapse on to carrying out the work pending for the study is the mover and	
3308860	3313420	the second I'm really happy with accepting second already known mr.	
3313420	3318820	man I'm sorry I've lived through this for quite a few months	
3318820	3327780	is that what any of the council's like to second my amendment so we can speak	
3327780	3342060	to it would be good have you got up there all right so count of Jago is	
3342060	3352340	point numbers is that your whole one two three this is what your amendment is one	
3352340	3359540	two three right that's what he's it's not quite the same hang on that's what	
3359540	3362380	you got that	
3365940	3371940	that'll do enough so as we accept it do we have a seconder if it doesn't get a	
3371940	3376500	seconder it lapses please accept how it actually debated I think it's worthy of	
3376500	3384020	debate one two three laps all right all right sorry	
3384020	3388460	council Jago there's no support on the floor for that to be debated so it	
3388460	3394380	stands the motion as moved and second and that's what we're debating if you	
3394380	3399420	want to speak against it you can speak against it so I'll ask someone that	
3399420	3404460	doesn't want to would like to speak against the motion before us	
3404460	3408820	against it thank you	
3415060	3422580	I'd like to first of all acknowledge the really strong experience on both sides	
3422580	3428700	of this debate okay can you talk to the chair not to the audience it's not I	
3428700	3437700	support that experience mr. mayor I do at the same time we have to acknowledge	
3437700	3443580	there is a diversity of views here and when we have that notorious socialist	
3443580	3448820	organization transport for New South Wales saying that's not they don't agree	
3448820	3456620	with this approach proposal I think it's worthy of examination so we certainly	
3456620	3462260	have concerns from the cyclists because you know once that separated cycleway	
3462260	3466940	is taken out then they're in greater danger and lives are at risk on the other	
3466940	3473220	hand we have legitimate concerns from the residents but their response I	
3473220	3477860	believe is to throw out the baby with the bathwater and and I won't mention	
3477860	3482300	the council expense we're talking about safety here but let's stop and think	
3482300	3487100	about it let's stop and think about it we've got the offer of real expertise	
3487100	3493460	and let's isolate the specific issues that are going on here we've we've got	
3493460	3497140	an offer from transport for New South Wales to actually help us work it	
3497140	3502580	through bicycle New South Wales have made the same offer and in fact the CEO	
3502580	3508580	called me and made that offer and that's open there is enormous expertise out	
3508580	3516580	there and we simply go with what will be a dumbed down response excuse me then	
3516580	3524500	that's not where we need to be let's apply an intelligent response that gets	
3524500	3531220	the maximum out of it instead of in the jerk reaction and that's why I say let's	
3531220	3536340	let's do it properly let's not do it half-assed excuse me let's do it	
3536340	3547140	properly take the offer okay before we move on have we had any incident report	
3547140	3552100	reports to council about matters down there at history	
3558140	3562580	three mr. mayor there's two insurance claims and another incident which I	
3562580	3568340	think was referred to earlier as an accident that we were aware of prior to	
3568340	3576620	that were any incident reports for Heath Street on record that we know no	
3576620	3583100	okay all right um council Megner sorry I'll ask for any speakers for them the	
3583100	3598860	motion is a second wish to speak to it mr. mayor sometimes things don't go our	
3598860	3604300	way or there has there is unintended consequences certainly the insurance	
3604300	3610660	claims and liability and trip hazards those unintended consequences and no	
3610660	3616300	amount of compensation will give back a someone who loses a family member	
3616300	3626860	because of an accident because of blind spots I appreciate the funding may	
3626860	3634140	involve some clawback potentially but I think we've got a proceed with the	
3634140	3642660	recommendation thank you any councillors that would like to speak on this item	
3642660	3649300	councilor Gordaro thank you mr. mayor just in brief look I can sense it the	
3649300	3653300	prevailing attitude here amongst all members who have come to speak tonight	
3653300	3660260	in the community the greater communities that they do support cycleways and that	
3660260	3665540	we and there is an acknowledgement that cars and bicycles need to share roads I	
3665540	3672860	can't imagine how blocks placed on a street that are 300 or 400 millimeters	
3672860	3678580	above ground level can ever be safe that gives license to cyclists to you know	
3678580	3683340	travel at 30 40 kilometers an hour along there I live on a stretch of road in	
3683340	3689420	Des Moines Wrights Road and Renwick Street that has safe bike transit going	
3689420	3695660	through it without such a cycle lanes constructed in Heath Street and I think	
3695660	3700060	there are other solutions and I can't see that deferring this for further	
3700060	3704060	consultation will actually come up with a solution that involves leaving the	
3704060	3716180	blocks with our speakers council make no further just sum up I think we've got a	
3716180	3720900	responsibility to the residents the safety of residents and the safety of	
3720900	3727340	cyclists both because there have been accidents there could be other	
3727340	3732500	accidents I have been down there when there have been near misses it isn't	
3732500	3735900	safe the way it is we're not throwing the baby out with the bath water as some	
3735900	3742100	people have said it is a very small street in a very large network and	
3742100	3748900	councillors have a long-standing history of supporting cycle networks we're not	
3748900	3754220	throwing the baby out with a bath water cyclists also have to be aware that	
3754220	3758660	there are pedestrians and cars around it's not just used for cyclists and	
3758660	3764700	while we've got all the bodies here can you tell your cyclists who speed down	
3764700	3769460	Henry Street and don't stop at great North Road where it says cyclists	
3769460	3774700	dismount and they speed across how many new missus I've seen knocking	
3774700	3779060	pedestrians over knocking little old ladies and swearing at little old ladies	
3779060	3785180	because they got in the way of cyclists and I've said to a few of them why don't	
3785180	3788540	you get off your bike because it says cyclists dismount oh it cuts into our	
3788540	3793380	into our time well it's not a race it's not a marathon it's not the Grand Prix	
3793380	3798740	of cyclists they have to be responsible for their own safety one has fallen off	
3798740	3806980	because he skidded so fast the same can happen here in Heath Street just to	
3806980	3812140	round it into Heath Street we're looking at a mentality and we're looking at	
3812140	3817220	safety the safety is paramount for the cyclists and for the pedestrians and for	
3817220	3821900	the residents coming out of their car driving out of their their driveways I	
3821900	3827340	think the recommendation is a suitable recommendation and is taking into	
3827340	3832860	consideration everyone's welfare okay close the debate I'm now going to put it	
3832860	3840820	all those in favor say aye those against no no the I think the eyes have it	
3840820	3845300	declare it carried thank you	
3845300	3859700	okay well what just wait till the gallery empties a bit and then I'm not	
3859700	3872700	gonna wait are you leaving the room just just adjourned the meeting until	
3872700	3876460	councillor Jio comes back it's removed in seconded council mechnek councillor
